    ["[1] The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.\n\n[2] Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers, [3] and Judah the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram, [4] and Ram the father of Amminadab, and Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon, [5] and Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse, [6] and Jesse the father of David the king.\n\nAnd David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah, [7] and Solomon the father of Rehoboam, and Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asaph, [8] and Asaph the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah, [9] and Uzziah the father of Jotham, and Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah, [10] and Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh the father of Amos, and Amos the father of Josiah, [11] and Josiah the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon. [12] And after the deportation to Babylon: Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel, [13] and Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, and Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor, [14] and Azor the father of Zadok, and Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud, [15] and Eliud the father of Eleazar, and Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob, [16] and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.\n\n[17] So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.\n\n[18] Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. [19] And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. [20] But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, \"Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. [21] She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.\" [22] All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:\n\n[23] \"Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel\" (which means, God with us).\n\n[24] When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, [25] but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus."
    ,"[1] Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem [2] saying, \"Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.\" [3] When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; [4] and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. [5] They told him, \"In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:\n\n[6] \"'And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'\"\n\n[7] Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared. [8] And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, \"Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.\" [9] After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was. [10] When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. [11] And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. [12] And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.\n\n[13] Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, \"Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.\" [14] And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt [15] and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, \"Out of Egypt I called my son.\" [16] Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men. [17] Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:\n\n[18] \"A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be comforted, because they are no more.\"\n\n[19] But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, [20] saying, \"Rise, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead.\"[21] And he rose and took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel. [22] But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee. [23] And he went and lived in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, that he would be called a Nazarene."
    ,"[1] In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, [2] \"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\" [3] For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said,\n\n\"The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.'\"\n\n[4] Now John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. [5] Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him, [6] and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.\n\n[7] But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, \"You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? [8] Bear fruit in keeping with repentance. [9] And do not presume to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father,' for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham. [10] Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.\n\n[11] \"I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. [12] His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.\"\n\n[13] Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. [14] John would have prevented him, saying, \"I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?\" [15] But Jesus answered him, \"Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.\" Then he consented. [16] And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him; [17] and behold, a voice from heaven said, \"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.\""
    ,"[1] Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. [2] And after fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. [3] And the tempter came and said to him, \"If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.\" [4] But he answered, \"It is written,\n\n\"'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'\"\n\n[5] Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple [6] and said to him, \"If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written,\n\n\"'He will command his angels concerning you,'\n\nand\n\n\"'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'\"\n\n[7] Jesus said to him, \"Again it is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'\" [8] Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. [9] And he said to him, \"All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.\" [10] Then Jesus said to him, \"Be gone, Satan! For it is written,\n\n\"'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'\"\n\n[11] Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and were ministering to him.\n\n[12] Now when he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee. [13] And leaving Nazareth he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali, [14] so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:\n\n[15] \"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentilesâ[16] the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light, and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death, on them a light has dawned.\"\n\n[17] From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, \"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"\n\n[18] While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. [19] And he said to them, \"Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.\" [20] Immediately they left their nets and followed him. [21] And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them. [22] Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.\n\n[23] And he went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction among the people. [24] So his fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought him all the sick, those afflicted with various diseases and pains, those oppressed by demons, those having seizures, and paralytics, and he healed them. [25] And great crowds followed him from Galilee and the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan."
    ,"[1] Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him. [2] And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:\n\n[3] \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n[4] \"Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.\n[5] \"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.\n[6] \"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.\n[7] \"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.\n[8] \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\n[9] \"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.\n[10] \"Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n[11] \"Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. [12] Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.\n\n[13] \"You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet.\n\n[14] \"You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. [15] Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. [16] In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.\n\n[17] \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. [18] For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. [19] Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. [20] For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.\n\n[21] \"You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.' [22] But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, 'You fool!' will be liable to the hell of fire. [23] So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, [24] leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. [25] Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison. [26] Truly, I say to you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.\n\n[27] \"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' [28] But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. [29] If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. [30] And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.\n\n[31] \"It was also said, 'Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.' [32] But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.\n\n[33] \"Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.' [34] But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, [35] or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. [36] And do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. [37] Let what you say be simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything more than this comes from evil.\n\n[38] \"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' [39] But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. [40] And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. [41] And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. [42] Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.\n\n[43] \"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' [44] But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, [45] so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. [46] For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? [47] And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? [48] You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
    ,"[1] \"Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.\n\n[2] \"Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. [3] But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, [4] so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.\n\n[5] \"And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. [6] But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.\n\n[7] \"And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. [8] Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. [9] Pray then like this:\n\n\"Our Father in heaven,\nhallowed be your name.\n[10] Your kingdom come,\nyour will be done,\non earth as it is in heaven.\n[11] Give us this day our daily bread,\n[12] and forgive us our debts,\nas we also have forgiven our debtors.\n[13] And lead us not into temptation,\nbut deliver us from evil.\n\n[14] For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, [15] but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\n\n[16] \"And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. [17] But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, [18] that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.\n\n[19] \"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, [20] but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. [21] For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\n\n[22] \"The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light, [23] but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!\n\n[24] \"No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.\n\n[25] \"Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? [26] Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? [27] And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? [28] And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, [29] yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. [30] But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? [31] Therefore do not be anxious, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' [32] For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. [33] But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.\n\n[34] \"Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.\""
    ,"[1] \"Judge not, that you be not judged. [2] For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. [3] Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? [4] Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when there is the log in your own eye? [5] You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.\n\n[6] \"Do not give dogs what is holy, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you.\n\n[7] \"Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. [8] For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. [9] Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? [10] Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? [11] If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!\n\n[12] \"So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.\n\n[13] \"Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. [14] For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few.\n\n[15] \"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. [16] You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? [17] So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. [18] A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit. [19] Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. [20] Thus you will recognize them by their fruits.\n\n[21] \"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. [22] On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' [23] And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'\n\n[24] \"Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. [25] And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. [26] And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. [27] And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.\"\n\n[28] And when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching, [29] for he was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes."
    ,"[1] When he came down from the mountain, great crowds followed him. [2] And behold, a leper came to him and knelt before him, saying, \"Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.\" [3] And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, \"I will; be clean.\" And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. [4] And Jesus said to him, \"See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof to them.\"\n\n[5] When he had entered Capernaum, a centurion came forward to him, appealing to him, [6] \"Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, suffering terribly.\" [7] And he said to him, \"I will come and heal him.\" [8] But the centurion replied, \"Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed. [9] For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.\" [10] When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, \"Truly, I tell you, with no one in Israel have I found such faith. [11] I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, [12] while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\" [13] And to the centurion Jesus said, \"Go; let it be done for you as you have believed.\" And the servant was healed at that very moment.\n\n[14] And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever. [15] He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and began to serve him. [16] That evening they brought to him many who were oppressed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick. [17] This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: \"He took our illnesses and bore our diseases.\"\n\n[18] Now when Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave orders to go over to the other side. [19] And a scribe came up and said to him, \"Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.\" [20] And Jesus said to him, \"Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\" [21] Another of the disciples said to him, \"Lord, let me first go and bury my father.\" [22] And Jesus said to him, \"Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.\"\n\n[23] And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him. [24] And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but he was asleep. [25] And they went and woke him, saying, \"Save us, Lord; we are perishing.\" [26] And he said to them, \"Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?\" Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. [27] And the men marveled, saying, \"What sort of man is this, that even winds and sea obey him?\"\n\n[28] And when he came to the other side to the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met him, coming out of the tombs, so fierce that no one could pass that way. [29] And behold, they cried out, \"What have you to do with us, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?\" [30] Now a herd of many pigs was feeding at some distance from them. [31] And the demons begged him, saying, \"If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of pigs.\" [32] And he said to them, \"Go.\" So they came out and went into the pigs, and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the waters. [33] The herdsmen fled, and going into the city they told everything, especially what had happened to the demon-possessed men. [34] And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region."
    ,"[1] And getting into a boat he crossed over and came to his own city. [2] And behold, some people brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, \"Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven.\" [3] And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, \"This man is blaspheming.\" [4] But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, \"Why do you think evil in your hearts? [5] For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'? [6] But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\"âhe then said to the paralyticâ\"Rise, pick up your bed and go home.\" [7] And he rose and went home. [8] When the crowds saw it, they were afraid, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men.\n\n[9] As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, \"Follow me.\" And he rose and followed him.\n\n[10] And as Jesus reclined at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and his disciples. [11] And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, \"Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?\" [12] But when he heard it, he said, \"Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. [13] Go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.' For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.\"\n\n[14] Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, \"Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?\" [15] And Jesus said to them, \"Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast. [16] No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch tears away from the garment, and a worse tear is made. [17] Neither is new wine put into old wineskins. If it is, the skins burst and the wine is spilled and the skins are destroyed. But new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved.\"\n\n[18] While he was saying these things to them, behold, a ruler came in and knelt before him, saying, \"My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.\" [19] And Jesus rose and followed him, with his disciples. [20] And behold, a woman who had suffered from a discharge of blood for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment, [21] for she said to herself, \"If I only touch his garment, I will be made well.\" [22] Jesus turned, and seeing her he said, \"Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well.\" And instantly the woman was made well. [23] And when Jesus came to the ruler's house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion, [24] he said, \"Go away, for the girl is not dead but sleeping.\" And they laughed at him. [25] But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose. [26] And the report of this went through all that district.\n\n[27] And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, \"Have mercy on us, Son of David.\" [28] When he entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, \"Do you believe that I am able to do this?\" They said to him, \"Yes, Lord.\" [29] Then he touched their eyes, saying, \"According to your faith be it done to you.\" [30] And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, \"See that no one knows about it.\" [31] But they went away and spread his fame through all that district.\n\n[32] As they were going away, behold, a demon-oppressed man who was mute was brought to him. [33] And when the demon had been cast out, the mute man spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, \"Never was anything like this seen in Israel.\" [34] But the Pharisees said, \"He casts out demons by the prince of demons.\"\n\n[35] And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction. [36] When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. [37] Then he said to his disciples, \"The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; [38] therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.\""
    ,"[1] And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction. [2] The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; [3] Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; [4] Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.\n\n[5] These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them, \"Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans, [6] but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. [7] And proclaim as you go, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' [8] Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You received without paying; give without pay. [9] Acquire no gold or silver or copper for your belts, [10] no bag for your journey, or two tunics or sandals or a staff, for the laborer deserves his food. [11] And whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy in it and stay there until you depart. [12] As you enter the house, greet it. [13] And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. [14] And if anyone will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town. [15] Truly, I say to you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.\n\n[16] \"Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. [17] Beware of men, for they will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues, [18] and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles. [19] When they deliver you over, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say, for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour. [20] For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. [21] Brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death, [22] and you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. [23] When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next, for truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.\n\n[24] \"A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. [25] It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his household.\n\n[26] \"So have no fear of them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. [27] What I tell you in the dark, say in the light, and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops. [28] And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. [29] Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. [30] But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. [31] Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. [32] So everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven, [33] but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.\n\n[34] \"Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. [35] For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. [36] And a person's enemies will be those of his own household. [37] Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. [38] And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. [39] Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.\n\n[40] \"Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. [41] The one who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and the one who receives a righteous person because he is a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward. [42] And whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward.\""
    ,"[1] When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.\n\n[2] Now when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent word by his disciples [3] and said to him, \"Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?\" [4] And Jesus answered them, \"Go and tell John what you hear and see: [5] the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. [6] And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.\"\n\n[7] As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? [8] What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. [9] What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. [10] This is he of whom it is written,\n\n\"'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'\n\n[11] Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. [12] From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force. [13] For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John, [14] and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. [15] He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\n\n[16] \"But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their playmates,\n\n[17] \"'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'\n\n[18] For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' [19] The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds.\"\n\n[20] Then he began to denounce the cities where most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent. [21] \"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. [22] But I tell you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you. [23] And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. [24] But I tell you that it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you.\"\n\n[25] At that time Jesus declared, \"I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children; [26] yes, Father, for such was your gracious will. [27] All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. [28] Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. [29] Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. [30] For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\""
    ,"[1] At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat. [2] But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, \"Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.\" [3] He said to them, \"Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him: [4] how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests? [5] Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless? [6] I tell you, something greater than the temple is here. [7] And if you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the guiltless. [8] For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.\"\n\n[9] He went on from there and entered their synagogue. [10] And a man was there with a withered hand. And they asked him, \"Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?\"âso that they might accuse him. [11] He said to them, \"Which one of you who has a sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out? [12] Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.\" [13] Then he said to the man, \"Stretch out your hand.\" And the man stretched it out, and it was restored, healthy like the other. [14] But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him, how to destroy him.\n\n[15] Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. And many followed him, and he healed them all [16] and ordered them not to make him known. [17] This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:\n\n[18] \"Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles. [19] He will not quarrel or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets; [20] a bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not quench, until he brings justice to victory; [21] and in his name the Gentiles will hope.\"\n\n[22] Then a demon-oppressed man who was blind and mute was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the man spoke and saw. [23] And all the people were amazed, and said, \"Can this be the Son of David?\" [24] But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, \"It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons.\" [25] Knowing their thoughts, he said to them, \"Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand. [26] And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? [27] And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. [28] But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. [29] Or how can someone enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house. [30] Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. [31] Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. [32] And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.\n\n[33] \"Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for the tree is known by its fruit. [34] You brood of vipers! How can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. [35] The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil. [36] I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, [37] for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.\"\n\n[38] Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, \"Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.\" [39] But he answered them, \"An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. [40] For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. [41] The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here. [42] The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.\n\n[43] \"When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, but finds none. [44] Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' And when it comes, it finds the house empty, swept, and put in order. [45] Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there, and the last state of that person is worse than the first. So also will it be with this evil generation.\"\n\n[46] While he was still speaking to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, asking to speak to him. [48] But he replied to the man who told him, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?\" [49] And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, \"Here are my mother and my brothers! [50] For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.\""
    ,"[1] That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea. [2] And great crowds gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the whole crowd stood on the beach. [3] And he told them many things in parables, saying: \"A sower went out to sow. [4] And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them. [5] Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil, [6] but when the sun rose they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away. [7] Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. [8] Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. [9] He who has ears, let him hear.\"\n\n[10] Then the disciples came and said to him, \"Why do you speak to them in parables?\" [11] And he answered them, \"To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. [12] For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. [13] This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. [14] Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says:\n\n\"'\"You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive.\" [15] For this people's heart has grown dull, and with their ears they can barely hear, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.'\n\n[16] But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. [17] For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.\n\n[18] \"Hear then the parable of the sower: [19] When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path. [20] As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, [21] yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away. [22] As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. [23] As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.\"\n\n[24] He put another parable before them, saying, \"The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field, [25] but while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away. [26] So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also. [27] And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, 'Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?' [28] He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' So the servants said to him, 'Then do you want us to go and gather them?' [29] But he said, 'No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them. [30] Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, \"Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.\"'\"\n\n[31] He put another parable before them, saying, \"The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field. [32] It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.\"\n\n[33] He told them another parable. \"The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till it was all leavened.\"\n\n[34] All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed, he said nothing to them without a parable. [35] This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet:\n\n\"I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world.\"\n\n[36] Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, \"Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.\" [37] He answered, \"The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man. [38] The field is the world, and the good seed is the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one, [39] and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. [40] Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of the age. [41] The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, [42] and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. [43] Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.\n\n[44] \"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.\n\n[45] \"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, [46] who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.\n\n[47] \"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind. [48] When it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad. [49] So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous [50] and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n\n[51] \"Have you understood all these things?\" They said to him, \"Yes.\" [52] And he said to them, \"Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.\"\n\n[53] And when Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there, [54] and coming to his hometown he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, \"Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works? [55] Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? [56] And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?\" [57] And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, \"A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household.\" [58] And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief."
    ,"[1] At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus, [2] and he said to his servants, \"This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.\" [3] For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, [4] because John had been saying to him, \"It is not lawful for you to have her.\" [5] And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet. [6] But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod, [7] so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. [8] Prompted by her mother, she said, \"Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.\" [9] And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given. [10] He sent and had John beheaded in the prison, [11] and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. [12] And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus.\n\n[13] Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns. [14] When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick. [15] Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, \"This is a desolate place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves.\" [16] But Jesus said, \"They need not go away; you give them something to eat.\" [17] They said to him, \"We have only five loaves here and two fish.\" [18] And he said, \"Bring them here to me.\" [19] Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. [20] And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over. [21] And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.\n\n[22] Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds. [23] And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone, [24] but the boat by this time was a long way from the land, beaten by the waves, for the wind was against them. [25] And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. [26] But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, \"It is a ghost!\" and they cried out in fear. [27] But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, \"Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.\"\n\n[28] And Peter answered him, \"Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.\" [29] He said, \"Come.\" So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus. [30] But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, \"Lord, save me.\" [31] Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, \"O you of little faith, why did you doubt?\" [32] And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased. [33] And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, \"Truly you are the Son of God.\"\n\n[34] And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret. [35] And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent around to all that region and brought to him all who were sick [36] and implored him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well."
    ,"[1] Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said, [2] \"Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat.\" [3] He answered them, \"And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? [4] For God commanded, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.' [5] But you say, 'If anyone tells his father or his mother, \"What you would have gained from me is given to God,\" [6] he need not honor his father.' So for the sake of your tradition you have made void the word of God. [7] You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said:\n\n[8] \"'This people honors me with their lips,\nbut their heart is far from me;\n[9] in vain do they worship me,\nteaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'\"\n\n[10] And he called the people to him and said to them, \"Hear and understand: [11] it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person.\" [12] Then the disciples came and said to him, \"Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?\" [13] He answered, \"Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up. [14] Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.\" [15] But Peter said to him, \"Explain the parable to us.\" [16] And he said, \"Are you also still without understanding? [17] Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled? [18] But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person. [19] For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander. [20] These are what defile a person. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile anyone.\"\n\n[21] And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon. [22] And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and was crying, \"Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon.\" [23] But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying, \"Send her away, for she is crying out after us.\" [24] He answered, \"I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\" [25] But she came and knelt before him, saying, \"Lord, help me.\" [26] And he answered, \"It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.\" [27] She said, \"Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.\" [28] Then Jesus answered her, \"O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire.\" And her daughter was healed instantly.\n\n[29] Jesus went on from there and walked beside the Sea of Galilee. And he went up on the mountain and sat down there. [30] And great crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and they put them at his feet, and he healed them, [31] so that the crowd wondered, when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.\n\n[32] Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, \"I have compassion on the crowd because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat. And I am unwilling to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.\" [33] And the disciples said to him, \"Where are we to get enough bread in such a desolate place to feed so great a crowd?\" [34] And Jesus said to them, \"How many loaves do you have?\" They said, \"Seven, and a few small fish.\" [35] And directing the crowd to sit down on the ground, [36] he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. [37] And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over. [38] Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. [39] And after sending away the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan."
    ,"[1] And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and to test him they asked him to show them a sign from heaven. [2] He answered them, \"When it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.' [3] And in the morning, 'It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and threatening.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. [4] An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.\" So he left them and departed.\n\n[5] When the disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to bring any bread. [6] Jesus said to them, \"Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\" [7] And they began discussing it among themselves, saying, \"We brought no bread.\" [8] But Jesus, aware of this, said, \"O you of little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have no bread? [9] Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered? [10] Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered? [11] How is it that you fail to understand that I did not speak about bread? Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\" [12] Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\n\n[13] Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, \"Who do people say that the Son of Man is?\" [14] And they said, \"Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.\" [15] He said to them, \"But who do you say that I am?\" [16] Simon Peter replied, \"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" [17] And Jesus answered him, \"Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. [18] And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. [19] I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\" [20] Then he strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.\n\n[21] From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised. [22] And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, \"Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you.\" [23] But he turned and said to Peter, \"Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.\"\n\n[24] Then Jesus told his disciples, \"If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. [25] For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. [26] For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul? [27] For the Son of Man is going to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay each person according to what he has done. [28] Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\""
    ,"[1] And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. [2] And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light. [3] And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him. [4] And Peter said to Jesus, \"Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.\" [5] He was still speaking when, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, \"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.\" [6] When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified. [7] But Jesus came and touched them, saying, \"Rise, and have no fear.\" [8] And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.\n\n[9] And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, \"Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.\" [10] And the disciples asked him, \"Then why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?\" [11] He answered, \"Elijah does come, and he will restore all things. [12] But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of Man will certainly suffer at their hands.\" [13] Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.\n\n[14] And when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and, kneeling before him, [15] said, \"Lord, have mercy on my son, for he has seizures and he suffers terribly. For often he falls into the fire, and often into the water. [16] And I brought him to your disciples, and they could not heal him.\" [17] And Jesus answered, \"O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to me.\" [18] And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was healed instantly. [19] Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, \"Why could we not cast it out?\" [20] He said to them, \"Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.\"\n\n[22] As they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said to them, \"The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men, [23] and they will kill him, and he will be raised on the third day.\" And they were greatly distressed.\n\n[24] When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma tax went up to Peter and said, \"Does your teacher not pay the tax?\" [25] He said, \"Yes.\" And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, \"What do you think, Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tax? From their sons or from others?\" [26] And when he said, \"From others,\" Jesus said to him, \"Then the sons are free. [27] However, not to give offense to them, go to the sea and cast a hook and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel. Take that and give it to them for me and for yourself.\""
    ,"[1] At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, \"Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\" [2] And calling to him a child, he put him in the midst of them [3] and said, \"Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. [4] Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.\n\n[5] \"Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, [6] but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.\n\n[7] \"Woe to the world for temptations to sin! For it is necessary that temptations come, but woe to the one by whom the temptation comes! [8] And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire. [9] And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire.\n\n[10] \"See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven. [12] What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray? [13] And if he finds it, truly, I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray. [14] So it is not the will of my Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.\n\n[15] \"If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. [16] But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. [17] If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. [18] Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. [19] Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. [20] For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.\"\n\n[21] Then Peter came up and said to him, \"Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?\" [22] Jesus said to him, \"I do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times.\n\n[23] \"Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants. [24] When he began to settle, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. [25] And since he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made. [26] So the servant fell on his knees, imploring him, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.' [27] And out of pity for him, the master of that servant released him and forgave him the debt. [28] But when that same servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii, and seizing him, he began to choke him, saying, 'Pay what you owe.' [29] So his fellow servant fell down and pleaded with him, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you.' [30] He refused and went and put him in prison until he should pay the debt. [31] When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their master all that had taken place. [32] Then his master summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. [33] And should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?' [34] And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers, until he should pay all his debt. [35] So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.\""
    ,"[1] Now when Jesus had finished these sayings, he went away from Galilee and entered the region of Judea beyond the Jordan. [2] And large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.\n\n[3] And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, \"Is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause?\" [4] He answered, \"Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, [5] and said, 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'? [6] So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.\" [7] They said to him, \"Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?\" [8] He said to them, \"Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. [9] And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.\"\n\n[10] The disciples said to him, \"If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.\" [11] But he said to them, \"Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given. [12] For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it.\"\n\n[13] Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked the people, [14] but Jesus said, \"Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.\" [15] And he laid his hands on them and went away.\n\n[16] And behold, a man came up to him, saying, \"Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?\" [17] And he said to him, \"Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments.\" [18] He said to him, \"Which ones?\" And Jesus said, \"You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, [19] Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\" [20] The young man said to him, \"All these I have kept. What do I still lack?\" [21] Jesus said to him, \"If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.\" [22] When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.\n\n[23] And Jesus said to his disciples, \"Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. [24] Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.\" [25] When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, \"Who then can be saved?\" [26] But Jesus looked at them and said, \"With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.\" [27] Then Peter said in reply, \"See, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?\" [28] Jesus said to them, \"Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. [29] And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life. [30] But many who are first will be last, and the last first."
    ,"[1] \"For the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. [2] After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. [3] And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the marketplace, [4] and to them he said, 'You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.' [5] So they went. Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same. [6] And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing. And he said to them, 'Why do you stand here idle all day?' [7] They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too.' [8] And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.' [9] And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius. [10] Now when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more, but each of them also received a denarius. [11] And on receiving it they grumbled at the master of the house, [12] saying, 'These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.' [13] But he replied to one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? [14] Take what belongs to you and go. I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you. [15] Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or do you begrudge my generosity?' [16] So the last will be first, and the first last.\"\n\n[17] And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them, [18] \"See, we are going up to Jerusalem. And the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death [19] and deliver him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified, and he will be raised on the third day.\"\n\n[20] Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came up to him with her sons, and kneeling before him she asked him for something. [21] And he said to her, \"What do you want?\" She said to him, \"Say that these two sons of mine are to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.\" [22] Jesus answered, \"You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am to drink?\" They said to him, \"We are able.\" [23] He said to them, \"You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.\" [24] And when the ten heard it, they were indignant at the two brothers. [25] But Jesus called them to him and said, \"You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. [26] It shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, [27] and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, [28] even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\"\n\n[29] And as they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him. [30] And behold, there were two blind men sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, \"Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!\" [31] The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be silent, but they cried out all the more, \"Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!\" [32] And stopping, Jesus called them and said, \"What do you want me to do for you?\" [33] They said to him, \"Lord, let our eyes be opened.\" [34] And Jesus in pity touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight and followed him."
    ,"[1] Now when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, [2] saying to them, \"Go into the village in front of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me. [3] If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord needs them,' and he will send them at once.\" [4] This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying,\n\n[5] \"Say to the daughter of Zion,\n'Behold, your king is coming to you,\nhumble, and mounted on a donkey,\non a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.'\"\n\n[6] The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them. [7] They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks, and he sat on them. [8] Most of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. [9] And the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting, \"Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!\" [10] And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, \"Who is this?\" [11] And the crowds said, \"This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.\"\n\n[12] And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. [13] He said to them, \"It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you make it a den of robbers.\"\n\n[14] And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them. [15] But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple, \"Hosanna to the Son of David!\" they were indignant, [16] and they said to him, \"Do you hear what these are saying?\" And Jesus said to them, \"Yes; have you never read,\n\n\"'Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies\nyou have prepared praise'?\"\n\n[17] And leaving them, he went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there.\n\n[18] In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he became hungry. [19] And seeing a fig tree by the wayside, he went to it and found nothing on it but only leaves. And he said to it, \"May no fruit ever come from you again!\" And the fig tree withered at once.\n\n[20] When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, \"How did the fig tree wither at once?\" [21] And Jesus answered them, \"Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen. [22] And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.\"\n\n[23] And when he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, \"By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?\" [24] Jesus answered them, \"I also will ask you one question, and if you tell me the answer, then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things. [25] The baptism of John, from where did it come? From heaven or from man?\" And they discussed it among themselves, saying, \"If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?' [26] But if we say, 'From man,' we are afraid of the crowd, for they all hold that John was a prophet.\" [27] So they answered Jesus, \"We do not know.\" And he said to them, \"Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\n\n[28] \"What do you think? A man had two sons. And he went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work in the vineyard today.' [29] And he answered, 'I will not,' but afterward he changed his mind and went. [30] And he went to the other son and said the same. And he answered, 'I go, sir,' but did not go. [31] Which of the two did the will of his father?\" They said, \"The first.\" Jesus said to them, \"Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you. [32] For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him.\n\n[33] \"Hear another parable. There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and leased it to tenants, and went into another country. [34] When the season for fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to get his fruit. [35] And the tenants took his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another. [36] Again he sent other servants, more than the first. And they did the same to them. [37] Finally he sent his son to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' [38] But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and have his inheritance.' [39] And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. [40] When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?\" [41] They said to him, \"He will put those wretches to a miserable death and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons.\"\n\n[42] Jesus said to them, \"Have you never read in the Scriptures:\n\n\"'The stone that the builders rejected\nhas become the cornerstone;\nthis was the Lord's doing,\nand it is marvelous in our eyes'?\n\n[43] Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits. [44] And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.\"\n\n[45] When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he was speaking about them. [46] And although they were seeking to arrest him, they feared the crowds, because they held him to be a prophet."
    ,"[1] And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying, [2] \"The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son, [3] and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come. [4] Again he sent other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, \"See, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.\"' [5] But they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business, [6] while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. [7] The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. [8] Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy. [9] Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.' [10] And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests.\n\n[11] \"But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment. [12] And he said to him, 'Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?' And he was speechless. [13] Then the king said to the attendants, 'Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' [14] For many are called, but few are chosen.\"\n\n[15] Then the Pharisees went and plotted how to entangle him in his words. [16] And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, \"Teacher, we know that you are true and teach the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone's opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances. [17] Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?\" [18] But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, \"Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? [19] Show me the coin for the tax.\" And they brought him a denarius. [20] And Jesus said to them, \"Whose likeness and inscription is this?\" [21] They said, \"Caesar's.\" Then he said to them, \"Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\" [22] When they heard it, they marveled. And they left him and went away.\n\n[23] The same day Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him a question, [24] saying, \"Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies having no children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.' [25] Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died, and having no offspring left his wife to his brother. [26] So too the second and third, down to the seventh. [27] After them all, the woman died. [28] In the resurrection, therefore, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her.\"\n\n[29] But Jesus answered them, \"You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God. [30] For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. [31] And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God: [32] 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not God of the dead, but of the living.\" [33] And when the crowd heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.\n\n[34] But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. [35] And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. [36] \"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?\" [37] And he said to him, \"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. [38] This is the great and first commandment. [39] And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. [40] On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.\"\n\n[41] Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, [42] saying, \"What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?\" They said to him, \"The son of David.\" [43] He said to them, \"How is it then that David, in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying,\n\n[44] \"'The Lord said to my Lord,\n\"Sit at my right hand,\nuntil I put your enemies under your feet\"'?\n\n[45] If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?\" [46] And no one was able to answer him a word, nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions."
    ,"[1] Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, [2] \"The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat, [3] so do and observe whatever they tell you, but not the works they do. For they preach, but do not practice. [4] They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on people's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger. [5] They do all their deeds to be seen by others. For they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long, [6] and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues [7] and greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi by others. [8] But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers. [9] And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. [10] Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ. [11] The greatest among you shall be your servant. [12] Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.\n\n[13] \"But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. For you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in. [15] Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel across sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.\n\n[16] \"Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.' [17] You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred? [18] And you say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gift that is on the altar, he is bound by his oath.' [19] You blind men! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred? [20] So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it. [21] And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and by him who dwells in it. [22] And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it.\n\n[23] \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others. [24] You blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel!\n\n[25] \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. [26] You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, that the outside also may be clean.\n\n[27] \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness. [28] So you also outwardly appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.\n\n[29] \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous, [30] saying, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' [31] Thus you witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. [32] Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers. [33] You serpents, you brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell? [34] Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town, [35] so that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. [36] Truly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.\n\n[37] \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing! [38] See, your house is left to you desolate. [39] For I tell you, you will not see me again, until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'\""
    ,"[1] Jesus left the temple and was going away, when his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple. [2] But he answered them, \"You see all these, do you not? Truly, I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.\"\n\n[3] As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, \"Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?\" [4] And Jesus answered them, \"See that no one leads you astray. [5] For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and they will lead many astray. [6] And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. [7] For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. [8] All these are but the beginning of the birth pains.\n\n[9] \"Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake. [10] And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another. [11] And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. [12] And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. [13] But the one who endures to the end will be saved. [14] And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\n\n[15] \"So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), [16] then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. [17] Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house, [18] and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. [19] And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! [20] Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. [21] For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. [22] And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. [23] Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There he is!' do not believe it. [24] For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. [25] See, I have told you beforehand. [26] So, if they say to you, 'Look, he is in the wilderness,' do not go out. If they say, 'Look, he is in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. [27] For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. [28] Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.\n\n[29] \"Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. [30] Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. [31] And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.\n\n[32] \"From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near. [33] So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very gates. [34] Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. [35] Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.\n\n[36] \"But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. [37] For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. [38] For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, [39] and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. [40] Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left. [41] Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left. [42] Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. [43] But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. [44] Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.\n\n[45] \"Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time? [46] Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes. [47] Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. [48] But if that wicked servant says to himself, 'My master is delayed,' [49] and begins to beat his fellow servants and eats and drinks with drunkards, [50] the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know [51] and will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
    ,"[1] \"Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. [2] Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. [3] For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them, [4] but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. [5] As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept. [6] But at midnight there was a cry, 'Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.' [7] Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. [8] And the foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.' [9] But the wise answered, saying, 'Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.' [10] And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. [11] Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, 'Lord, lord, open to us.' [12] But he answered, 'Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.' [13] Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.\n\n[14] \"For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property. [15] To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. [16] He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. [17] So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. [18] But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. [19] Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. [20] And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me five talents; here, I have made five talents more.' [21] His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.' [22] And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me two talents; here, I have made two talents more.' [23] His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.' [24] He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, [25] so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, you have what is yours.' [26] But his master answered him, 'You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed? [27] Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. [28] So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. [29] For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. [30] And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'\n\n[31] \"When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. [32] Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. [33] And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. [34] Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. [35] For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, [36] I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.' [37] Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? [38] And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? [39] And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?' [40] And the King will answer them, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.'\n\n[41] \"Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. [42] For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, [43] I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.' [44] Then they also will answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?' [45] Then he will answer them, saying, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.' [46] And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.\""
    ,"[1] When Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples, [2] \"You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.\"\n\n[3] Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas, [4] and plotted together in order to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him. [5] But they said, \"Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.\"\n\n[6] Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, [7] a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he reclined at table. [8] And when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, \"Why this waste? [9] For this could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor.\" [10] But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, \"Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me. [11] For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me. [12] In pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it to prepare me for burial. [13] Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.\"\n\n[14] Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests [15] and said, \"What will you give me if I deliver him over to you?\" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver. [16] And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him.\n\n[17] Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, \"Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover?\" [18] He said, \"Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, 'The Teacher says, My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'\" [19] And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.\n\n[20] When it was evening, he reclined at table with the twelve. [21] And as they were eating, he said, \"Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.\" [22] And they were very sorrowful and began to say to him one after another, \"Is it I, Lord?\" [23] He answered, \"He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me. [24] The Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.\" [25] Judas, who would betray him, answered, \"Is it I, Rabbi?\" He said to him, \"You have said so.\"\n\n[26] Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, \"Take, eat; this is my body.\" [27] And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, \"Drink of it, all of you, [28] for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. [29] I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.\"\n\n[30] And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. [31] Then Jesus said to them, \"You will all fall away because of me this night. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' [32] But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.\" [33] Peter answered him, \"Though they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.\" [34] Jesus said to him, \"Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.\" [35] Peter said to him, \"Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you!\" And all the disciples said the same.\n\n[36] Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, \"Sit here, while I go over there and pray.\" [37] And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. [38] Then he said to them, \"My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.\" [39] And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, \"My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.\" [40] And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, \"So, could you not watch with me one hour? [41] Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\" [42] Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, \"My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.\" [43] And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. [44] So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words again. [45] Then he came to the disciples and said to them, \"Sleep and take your rest later on. See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. [46] Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.\"\n\n[47] While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people. [48] Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, \"The one I will kiss is the man; seize him.\" [49] And he came up to Jesus at once and said, \"Greetings, Rabbi!\" And he kissed him. [50] Jesus said to him, \"Friend, do what you came to do.\" Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him. [51] And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. [52] Then Jesus said to him, \"Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword. [53] Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? [54] But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?\" [55] At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, \"Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. [56] But all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.\" Then all the disciples left him and fled.\n\n[57] Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered. [58] And Peter was following him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end. [59] Now the chief priests and the whole council were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death, [60] but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward [61] and said, \"This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in three days.'\" [62] And the high priest stood up and said, \"Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?\" [63] But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, \"I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.\" [64] Jesus said to him, \"You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" [65] Then the high priest tore his robes and said, \"He has uttered blasphemy. What further witnesses do we need? You have now heard his blasphemy. [66] What is your judgment?\" They answered, \"He deserves death.\" [67] Then they spit in his face and struck him. And some slapped him, [68] saying, \"Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?\"\n\n[69] Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came up to him and said, \"You also were with Jesus the Galilean.\" [70] But he denied it before them all, saying, \"I do not know what you mean.\" [71] And when he went out to the entrance, another servant girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders, \"This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.\" [72] And again he denied it with an oath: \"I do not know the man.\" [73] After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, \"Certainly you too are one of them, for your accent betrays you.\" [74] Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, \"I do not know the man.\" And immediately the rooster crowed. [75] And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, \"Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.\" And he went out and wept bitterly."
    ,"[1] When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death. [2] And they bound him and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate the governor.\n\n[3] Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he changed his mind and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, [4] saying, \"I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.\" They said, \"What is that to us? See to it yourself.\" [5] And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself. [6] But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, \"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money.\" [7] So they took counsel and bought with them the potter's field as a burial place for strangers. [8] Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. [9] Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel, [10] and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me.\"\n\n[11] Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, \"Are you the King of the Jews?\" Jesus said, \"You have said so.\" [12] But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer. [13] Then Pilate said to him, \"Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?\" [14] But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.\n\n[15] Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted. [16] And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. [17] So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, \"Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?\" [18] For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up. [19] Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, \"Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today in a dream.\" [20] Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. [21] The governor again said to them, \"Which of the two do you want me to release for you?\" And they said, \"Barabbas.\" [22] Pilate said to them, \"Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?\" They all said, \"Let him be crucified!\" [23] And he said, \"Why? What evil has he done?\" But they shouted all the more, \"Let him be crucified!\"\n\n[24] So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, \"I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves.\" [25] And all the people answered, \"His blood be on us and on our children!\" [26] Then he released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.\n\n[27] Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor's headquarters, and they gathered the whole battalion before him. [28] And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, [29] and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, \"Hail, King of the Jews!\" [30] And they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head. [31] And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and led him away to crucify him.\n\n[32] As they went out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They compelled this man to carry his cross. [33] And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull), [34] they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall, but when he tasted it, he would not drink it. [35] And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots. [36] Then they sat down and kept watch over him there. [37] And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, \"This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.\" [38] Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left. [39] And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads [40] and saying, \"You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.\" [41] So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying, [42] \"He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. [43] He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him. For he said, 'I am the Son of God.'\" [44] And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.\n\n[45] Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. [46] And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, \"Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?\" that is, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" [47] And some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, \"This man is calling Elijah.\" [48] And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink. [49] But the others said, \"Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.\" [50] And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.\n\n[51] And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split. [52] The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, [53] and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many. [54] When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe and said, \"Truly this was the Son of God!\"\n\n[55] There were also many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him, [56] among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.\n\n[57] When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. [58] He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. [59] And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud [60] and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. [61] Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.\n\n[62] The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate [63] and said, \"Sir, we remember how that impostor said, while he was still alive, 'After three days I will rise.' [64] Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last fraud will be worse than the first.\" [65] Pilate said to them, \"You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can.\" [66] So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard."
    ,"[1] Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. [2] And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it. [3] His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. [4] And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men. [5] But the angel said to the women, \"Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. [6] He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay. [7] Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. See, I have told you.\" [8] So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples. [9] And behold, Jesus met them and said, \"Greetings!\" And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him. [10] Then Jesus said to them, \"Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.\"\n\n[11] While they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place. [12] And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers [13] and said, \"Tell people, 'His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.' [14] And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.\" [15] So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.\n\n[16] Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. [17] And when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted. [18] And Jesus came and said to them, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. [19] Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, [20] teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.\""]
    ,"Mark":[
    "[1] The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.\n\n[2] As it is written in Isaiah the prophet,\n\n\"Behold, I send my messenger before your face,\nwho will prepare your way,\n[3] the voice of one crying in the wilderness:\n'Prepare the way of the Lord,\nmake his paths straight,'\"\n\n[4] John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. [5] And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. [6] Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey. [7] And he preached, saying, \"After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. [8] I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.\"\n\n[9] In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. [10] And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. [11] And a voice came from heaven, \"You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.\"\n\n[12] The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. [13] And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.\n\n[14] Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God, [15] and saying, \"The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.\"\n\n[16] Passing alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. [17] And Jesus said to them, \"Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men.\" [18] And immediately they left their nets and followed him. [19] And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets. [20] And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed him.\n\n[21] And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and was teaching. [22] And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. [23] And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out, [24] \"What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you areâthe Holy One of God.\" [25] But Jesus rebuked him, saying, \"Be silent, and come out of him!\" [26] And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, came out of him. [27] And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, \"What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.\" [28] And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.\n\n[29] And immediately he left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. [30] Now Simon's mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. [31] And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.\n\n[32] That evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or oppressed by demons. [33] And the whole city was gathered together at the door. [34] And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. And he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.\n\n[35] And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed. [36] And Simon and those who were with him searched for him, [37] and they found him and said to him, \"Everyone is looking for you.\" [38] And he said to them, \"Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out.\" [39] And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.\n\n[40] And a leper came to him, imploring him, and kneeling said to him, \"If you will, you can make me clean.\" [41] Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, \"I will; be clean.\" [42] And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean. [43] And Jesus sternly charged him and sent him away at once, [44] and said to him, \"See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to them.\" [45] But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in desolate places, and people were coming to him from every quarter."
    ,"[1] And when he returned to Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home. [2] And many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even at the door. And he was preaching the word to them. [3] And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men. [4] And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him, and when they had made an opening, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay. [5] And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, \"Son, your sins are forgiven.\" [6] Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, [7] \"Why does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?\" [8] And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, \"Why do you question these things in your hearts? [9] Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise, take up your bed and walk'? [10] But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\"âhe said to the paralyticâ[11] \"I say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home.\" [12] And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, \"We never saw anything like this!\"\n\n[13] He went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he was teaching them. [14] And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, \"Follow me.\" And he rose and followed him.\n\n[15] And as he reclined at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. [16] And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, \"Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?\" [17] And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, \"Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.\"\n\n[18] Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. And people came and said to him, \"Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?\" [19] And Jesus said to them, \"Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. [20] The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day. [21] No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made. [22] And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skinsâand the wine is destroyed, and so are the skins. But new wine is for fresh wineskins.\"\n\n[23] One Sabbath he was going through the grainfields, and as they made their way, his disciples began to pluck heads of grain. [24] And the Pharisees were saying to him, \"Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?\" [25] And he said to them, \"Have you never read what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he and those who were with him: [26] how he entered the house of God, in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those who were with him?\" [27] And he said to them, \"The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. [28] So the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.\""
    ,"[1] Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there with a withered hand. [2] And they watched Jesus, to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him. [3] And he said to the man with the withered hand, \"Come here.\" [4] And he said to them, \"Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?\" But they were silent. [5] And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, \"Stretch out your hand.\" He stretched it out, and his hand was restored. [6] The Pharisees went out and immediately held counsel with the Herodians against him, how to destroy him.\n\n[7] Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great crowd followed, from Galilee and Judea [8] and Jerusalem and Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon. When the great crowd heard all that he was doing, they came to him. [9] And he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they crush him, [10] for he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed around him to touch him. [11] And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, \"You are the Son of God.\" [12] And he strictly ordered them not to make him known.\n\n[13] And he went up on the mountain and called to him those whom he desired, and they came to him. [14] And he appointed twelve (whom he also named apostles) so that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach [15] and have authority to cast out demons. [16] He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter); [17] James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder); [18] Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot, [19] and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.\n\n[20] Then he went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they could not even eat. [21] And when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, \"He is out of his mind.\"\n\n[22] And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, \"He is possessed by Beelzebul,\" and \"by the prince of demons he casts out the demons.\" [23] And he called them to him and said to them in parables, \"How can Satan cast out Satan? [24] If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. [25] And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. [26] And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end. [27] But no one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. Then indeed he may plunder his house.\n\n[28] \"Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the children of man, and whatever blasphemies they utter, [29] but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin\"â[30] for they were saying, \"He has an unclean spirit.\"\n\n[31] And his mother and his brothers came, and standing outside they sent to him and called him. [32] And a crowd was sitting around him, and they said to him, \"Your mother and your brothers are outside, seeking you.\" [33] And he answered them, \"Who are my mother and my brothers?\" [34] And looking about at those who sat around him, he said, \"Here are my mother and my brothers! [35] For whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother.\""
    ,"[1] Again he began to teach beside the sea. And a very large crowd gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat in it on the sea, and the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land. [2] And he was teaching them many things in parables, and in his teaching he said to them: [3] \"Listen! Behold, a sower went out to sow. [4] And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it. [5] Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth of soil. [6] And when the sun rose, it was scorched, and since it had no root, it withered away. [7] Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain. [8] And other seeds fell into good soil and produced grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.\" [9] And he said, \"He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\"\n\n[10] And when he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables. [11] And he said to them, \"To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables, [12] so that\n\n\"'they may indeed see but not perceive,\nand may indeed hear but not understand,\nlest they should turn and be forgiven.'\"\n\n[13] And he said to them, \"Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables? [14] The sower sows the word. [15] And these are the ones along the path, where the word is sown: when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them. [16] And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: the ones who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy. [17] And they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away. [18] And others are the ones sown among thorns. They are those who hear the word, [19] but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. [20] But those that were sown on the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.\"\n\n[21] And he said to them, \"Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket, or under a bed, and not on a stand? [22] For nothing is hidden except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret except to come to light. [23] If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.\" [24] And he said to them, \"Pay attention to what you hear: with the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and still more will be added to you. [25] For to the one who has, more will be given, and from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.\"\n\n[26] And he said, \"The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground. [27] He sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows; he knows not how. [28] The earth produces by itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. [29] But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.\"\n\n[30] And he said, \"With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it? [31] It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown on the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth, [32] yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and puts out large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.\"\n\n[33] With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it. [34] He did not speak to them without a parable, but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.\n\n[35] On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, \"Let us go across to the other side.\" [36] And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was. And other boats were with him. [37] And a great windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was already filling. [38] But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion. And they woke him and said to him, \"Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?\" [39] And he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, \"Peace! Be still!\" And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. [40] He said to them, \"Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?\" [41] And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, \"Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?\""
    ,"[1] They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes. [2] And when Jesus had stepped out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit. [3] He lived among the tombs. And no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain, [4] for he had often been bound with shackles and chains, but he wrenched the chains apart, and he broke the shackles in pieces. No one had the strength to subdue him. [5] Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones. [6] And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and fell down before him. [7] And crying out with a loud voice, he said, \"What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me.\" [8] For he was saying to him, \"Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!\" [9] And Jesus asked him, \"What is your name?\" He replied, \"My name is Legion, for we are many.\" [10] And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country. [11] Now a great herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, [12] and they begged him, saying, \"Send us to the pigs; let us enter them.\" [13] So he gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the sea.\n\n[14] The herdsmen fled and told it in the city and in the country. And people came to see what it was that had happened. [15] And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man, the one who had had the legion, sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. [16] And those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and to the pigs. [17] And they began to beg Jesus to depart from their region. [18] As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be with him. [19] And he did not permit him but said to him, \"Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.\" [20] And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and everyone marveled.\n\n[21] And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered about him, and he was beside the sea. [22] Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, and seeing him, he fell at his feet [23] and implored him earnestly, saying, \"My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well and live.\" [24] And he went with him.\n\nAnd a great crowd followed him and thronged about him. [25] And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, [26] and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but rather grew worse. [27] She had heard the reports about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment. [28] For she said, \"If I touch even his garments, I will be made well.\" [29] And immediately the flow of blood dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. [30] And Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone out from him, immediately turned about in the crowd and said, \"Who touched my garments?\" [31] And his disciples said to him, \"You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, 'Who touched me?'\" [32] And he looked around to see who had done it. [33] But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him and told him the whole truth. [34] And he said to her, \"Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.\"\n\n[35] While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler's house some who said, \"Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?\" [36] But overhearing what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, \"Do not fear, only believe.\" [37] And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter and James and John the brother of James. [38] They came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and Jesus saw a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly. [39] And when he had entered, he said to them, \"Why are you making a commotion and weeping? The child is not dead but sleeping.\" [40] And they laughed at him. But he put them all outside and took the child's father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was. [41] Taking her by the hand he said to her, \"Talitha cumi,\" which means, \"Little girl, I say to you, arise.\" [42] And immediately the girl got up and began walking (for she was twelve years of age), and they were immediately overcome with amazement. [43] And he strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat."
    ,"[1] He went away from there and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him. [2] And on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished, saying, \"Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to him? How are such mighty works done by his hands? [3] Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?\" And they took offense at him. [4] And Jesus said to them, \"A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household.\" [5] And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them. [6] And he marveled because of their unbelief.\n\nAnd he went about among the villages teaching.\n\n[7] And he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. [8] He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staffâno bread, no bag, no money in their beltsâ[9] but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics. [10] And he said to them, \"Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you depart from there. [11] And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.\" [12] So they went out and proclaimed that people should repent. [13] And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them.\n\n[14] King Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become known. Some said, \"John the Baptist has been raised from the dead. That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.\" [15] But others said, \"He is Elijah.\" And others said, \"He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.\" [16] But when Herod heard of it, he said, \"John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.\" [17] For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because he had married her. [18] For John had been saying to Herod, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\" [19] And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death. But she could not, [20] for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he heard him gladly.\n\n[21] But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. [22] For when Herodias's daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, \"Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.\" [23] And he vowed to her, \"Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.\" [24] And she went out and said to her mother, \"For what should I ask?\" And she said, \"The head of John the Baptist.\" [25] And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, \"I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\" [26] And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. [27] And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. He went and beheaded him in the prison [28] and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. [29] When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.\n\n[30] The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught. [31] And he said to them, \"Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while.\" For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat. [32] And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves. [33] Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. [34] When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things. [35] And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, \"This is a desolate place, and the hour is now late. [36] Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.\" [37] But he answered them, \"You give them something to eat.\" And they said to him, \"Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?\" [38] And he said to them, \"How many loaves do you have? Go and see.\" And when they had found out, they said, \"Five, and two fish.\" [39] Then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass. [40] So they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties. [41] And taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people. And he divided the two fish among them all. [42] And they all ate and were satisfied. [43] And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish. [44] And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.\n\n[45] Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. [46] And after he had taken leave of them, he went up on the mountain to pray. [47] And when evening came, the boat was out on the sea, and he was alone on the land. [48] And he saw that they were making headway painfully, for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. He meant to pass by them, [49] but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out, [50] for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, \"Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.\" [51] And he got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were utterly astounded, [52] for they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.\n\n[53] When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore. [54] And when they got out of the boat, the people immediately recognized him [55] and ran about the whole region and began to bring the sick people on their beds to wherever they heard he was. [56] And wherever he came, in villages, cities, or countryside, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and implored him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well."
    ,"[1] Now when the Pharisees gathered to him, with some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem, [2] they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed. [3] (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands properly, holding to the tradition of the elders, [4] and when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions that they observe, such as the washing of cups and pots and copper vessels and dining couches.) [5] And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, \"Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands?\" [6] And he said to them, \"Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,\n\n\"'This people honors me with their lips,\nbut their heart is far from me;\n[7] in vain do they worship me,\nteaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'\n\n[8] You leave the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men.\"\n\n[9] And he said to them, \"You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to establish your tradition! [10] For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.' [11] But you say, 'If a man tells his father or his mother, \"Whatever you would have gained from me is Corban\"' (that is, given to God)â[12] then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother, [13] thus making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And many such things you do.\"\n\n[14] And he called the people to him again and said to them, \"Hear me, all of you, and understand: [15] There is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him, but the things that come out of a person are what defile him.\" [17] And when he had entered the house and left the people, his disciples asked him about the parable. [18] And he said to them, \"Then are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him, [19] since it enters not his heart but his stomach, and is expelled?\" (Thus he declared all foods clean.) [20] And he said, \"What comes out of a person is what defiles him. [21] For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, [22] coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. [23] All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.\"\n\n[24] And from there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house and did not want anyone to know, yet he could not be hidden. [25] But immediately a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell down at his feet. [26] Now the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter. [27] And he said to her, \"Let the children be fed first, for it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.\" [28] But she answered him, \"Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.\" [29] And he said to her, \"For this statement you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter.\" [30] And she went home and found the child lying in bed and the demon gone.\n\n[31] Then he returned from the region of Tyre and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis. [32] And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had a speech impediment, and they begged him to lay his hand on him. [33] And taking him aside from the crowd privately, he put his fingers into his ears, and after spitting touched his tongue. [34] And looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, \"Ephphatha,\" that is, \"Be opened.\" [35] And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly. [36] And Jesus charged them to tell no one. But the more he charged them, the more zealously they proclaimed it. [37] And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, \"He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.\""
    ,"[1] In those days, when again a great crowd had gathered, and they had nothing to eat, he called his disciples to him and said to them, [2] \"I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat. [3] And if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way. And some of them have come from far away.\" [4] And his disciples answered him, \"How can one feed these people with bread here in this desolate place?\" [5] And he asked them, \"How many loaves do you have?\" They said, \"Seven.\" [6] And he directed the crowd to sit down on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the crowd. [7] And they had a few small fish. And having blessed them, he said that these also should be set before them. [8] And they ate and were satisfied. And they took up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full. [9] And there were about four thousand people. And he sent them away. [10] And immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.\n\n[11] The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him. [12] And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, \"Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.\" [13] And he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side.\n\n[14] Now they had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat. [15] And he cautioned them, saying, \"Watch out; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.\" [16] And they began discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread. [17] And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, \"Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened? [18] Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember? [19] When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?\" They said to him, \"Twelve.\" [20] \"And the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?\" And they said to him, \"Seven.\" [21] And he said to them, \"Do you not yet understand?\"\n\n[22] And they came to Bethsaida. And some people brought to him a blind man and begged him to touch him. [23] And he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village, and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him, he asked him, \"Do you see anything?\" [24] And he looked up and said, \"I see people, but they look like trees, walking.\" [25] Then Jesus laid his hands on his eyes again; and he opened his eyes, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. [26] And he sent him to his home, saying, \"Do not even enter the village.\"\n\n[27] And Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he asked his disciples, \"Who do people say that I am?\" [28] And they told him, \"John the Baptist; and others say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.\" [29] And he asked them, \"But who do you say that I am?\" Peter answered him, \"You are the Christ.\" [30] And he strictly charged them to tell no one about him.\n\n[31] And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again. [32] And he said this plainly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. [33] But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, \"Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.\"\n\n[34] And calling the crowd to him with his disciples, he said to them, \"If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. [35] For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it. [36] For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul? [37] For what can a man give in return for his soul? [38] For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.\""
    ,"[1] And he said to them, \"Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power.\"\n\n[2] And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, [3] and his clothes became radiant, intensely white, as no one on earth could bleach them. [4] And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus. [5] And Peter said to Jesus, \"Rabbi, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.\" [6] For he did not know what to say, for they were terrified. [7] And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, \"This is my beloved Son; listen to him.\" [8] And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only.\n\n[9] And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. [10] So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what this rising from the dead might mean. [11] And they asked him, \"Why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?\" [12] And he said to them, \"Elijah does come first to restore all things. And how is it written of the Son of Man that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt? [13] But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him.\"\n\n[14] And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them. [15] And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him, were greatly amazed and ran up to him and greeted him. [16] And he asked them, \"What are you arguing about with them?\" [17] And someone from the crowd answered him, \"Teacher, I brought my son to you, for he has a spirit that makes him mute. [18] And whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid. So I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able.\" [19] And he answered them, \"O faithless generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me.\" [20] And they brought the boy to him. And when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth. [21] And Jesus asked his father, \"How long has this been happening to him?\" And he said, \"From childhood. [22] And it has often cast him into fire and into water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.\" [23] And Jesus said to him, \"'If you can'! All things are possible for one who believes.\" [24] Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, \"I believe; help my unbelief!\" [25] And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, \"You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.\" [26] And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out, and the boy was like a corpse, so that most of them said, \"He is dead.\" [27] But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose. [28] And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, \"Why could we not cast it out?\" [29] And he said to them, \"This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer.\"\n\n[30] They went on from there and passed through Galilee. And he did not want anyone to know, [31] for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, \"The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he is killed, after three days he will rise.\" [32] But they did not understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.\n\n[33] And they came to Capernaum. And when he was in the house he asked them, \"What were you discussing on the way?\" [34] But they kept silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest. [35] And he sat down and called the twelve. And he said to them, \"If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.\" [36] And he took a child and put him in the midst of them, and taking him in his arms, he said to them, [37] \"Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me.\"\n\n[38] John said to him, \"Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he was not following us.\" [39] But Jesus said, \"Do not stop him, for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me. [40] For the one who is not against us is for us. [41] For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ will by no means lose his reward.\n\n[42] \"Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea. [43] And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell, to the unquenchable fire. [45] And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell. [47] And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell, [48] 'where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.' [49] For everyone will be salted with fire. [50] Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, how will you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.\""
    ,"[1] And he left there and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan, and crowds gathered to him again. And again, as was his custom, he taught them.\n\n[2] And Pharisees came up and in order to test him asked, \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?\" [3] He answered them, \"What did Moses command you?\" [4] They said, \"Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and to send her away.\" [5] And Jesus said to them, \"Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. [6] But from the beginning of creation, 'God made them male and female.' [7] 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, [8] and the two shall become one flesh.' So they are no longer two but one flesh. [9] What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.\"\n\n[10] And in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter. [11] And he said to them, \"Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her, [12] and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.\"\n\n[13] And they were bringing children to him that he might touch them, and the disciples rebuked them. [14] But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, \"Let the children come to me; do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. [15] Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.\" [16] And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands on them.\n\n[17] And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, \"Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" [18] And Jesus said to him, \"Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. [19] You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.'\" [20] And he said to him, \"Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth.\" [21] And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, \"You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.\" [22] Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.\n\n[23] And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, \"How difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!\" [24] And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, \"Children, how difficult it is to enter the kingdom of God! [25] It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.\" [26] And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, \"Then who can be saved?\" [27] Jesus looked at them and said, \"With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.\" [28] Peter began to say to him, \"See, we have left everything and followed you.\" [29] Jesus said, \"Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, [30] who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life. [31] But many who are first will be last, and the last first.\"\n\n[32] And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. And they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was to happen to him, [33] saying, \"See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and deliver him over to the Gentiles. [34] And they will mock him and spit on him, and flog him and kill him. And after three days he will rise.\"\n\n[35] And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, \"Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.\" [36] And he said to them, \"What do you want me to do for you?\" [37] And they said to him, \"Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.\" [38] Jesus said to them, \"You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?\" [39] And they said to him, \"We are able.\" And Jesus said to them, \"The cup that I drink you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized, [40] but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.\" [41] And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant at James and John. [42] And Jesus called them to him and said to them, \"You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. [43] But it shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, [44] and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all. [45] For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\"\n\n[46] And they came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside. [47] And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, \"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!\" [48] And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, \"Son of David, have mercy on me!\" [49] And Jesus stopped and said, \"Call him.\" And they called the blind man, saying to him, \"Take heart. Get up; he is calling you.\" [50] And throwing off his cloak, he sprang up and came to Jesus. [51] And Jesus said to him, \"What do you want me to do for you?\" And the blind man said to him, \"Rabbi, let me recover my sight.\" [52] And Jesus said to him, \"Go your way; your faith has made you well.\" And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him on the way."
    ,"[1] Now when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples [2] and said to them, \"Go into the village in front of you, and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it. [3] If anyone says to you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.'\" [4] And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street, and they untied it. [5] And some of those standing there said to them, \"What are you doing, untying the colt?\" [6] And they told them what Jesus had said, and they let them go. [7] And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it. [8] And many spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from the fields. [9] And those who went before and those who followed were shouting, \"Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! [10] Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!\"\n\n[11] And he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple. And when he had looked around at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.\n\n[12] On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry. [13] And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. [14] And he said to it, \"May no one ever eat fruit from you again.\" And his disciples heard it.\n\n[15] And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. [16] And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple. [17] And he was teaching them and saying to them, \"Is it not written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations'? But you have made it a den of robbers.\" [18] And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and were seeking a way to destroy him, for they feared him, because all the crowd was astonished at his teaching. [19] And when evening came they went out of the city.\n\n[20] As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots. [21] And Peter remembered and said to him, \"Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered.\" [22] And Jesus answered them, \"Have faith in God. [23] Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him. [24] Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. [25] And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.\"\n\n[27] And they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him, [28] and they said to him, \"By what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority to do them?\" [29] Jesus said to them, \"I will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. [30] Was the baptism of John from heaven or from man? Answer me.\" [31] And they discussed it with one another, saying, \"If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?' [32] But shall we say, 'From man'?\"âthey were afraid of the people, for they all held that John really was a prophet. [33] So they answered Jesus, \"We do not know.\" And Jesus said to them, \"Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\""
    ,"[1] And he began to speak to them in parables. \"A man planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a pit for the winepress and built a tower, and leased it to tenants and went into another country. [2] When the season came, he sent a servant to the tenants to get from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. [3] And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed. [4] Again he sent to them another servant, and they struck him on the head and treated him shamefully. [5] And he sent another, and him they killed. And so with many others: some they beat, and some they killed. [6] He had still one other, a beloved son. Finally he sent him to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' [7] But those tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.' [8] And they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard. [9] What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others. [10] Have you not read this Scripture:\n\n\"'The stone that the builders rejected\nhas become the cornerstone;\n[11] this was the Lord's doing,\nand it is marvelous in our eyes'?\"\n\n[12] And they were seeking to arrest him but feared the people, for they perceived that he had told the parable against them. So they left him and went away.\n\n[13] And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Herodians, to trap him in his talk. [14] And they came and said to him, \"Teacher, we know that you are true and do not care about anyone's opinion. For you are not swayed by appearances, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not?\" [15] But, knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, \"Why put me to the test? Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.\" [16] And they brought one. And he said to them, \"Whose likeness and inscription is this?\" They said to him, \"Caesar's.\" [17] Jesus said to them, \"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\" And they marveled at him.\n\n[18] And Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection. And they asked him a question, saying, [19] \"Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife, but leaves no child, the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. [20] There were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and when he died left no offspring. [21] And the second took her, and died, leaving no offspring. And the third likewise. [22] And the seven left no offspring. Last of all the woman also died. [23] In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.\"\n\n[24] Jesus said to them, \"Is this not the reason you are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God? [25] For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. [26] And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? [27] He is not God of the dead, but of the living. You are quite wrong.\"\n\n[28] And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, \"Which commandment is the most important of all?\" [29] Jesus answered, \"The most important is, 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. [30] And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' [31] The second is this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these.\" [32] And the scribe said to him, \"You are right, Teacher. You have truly said that he is one, and there is no other besides him. [33] And to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" [34] And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, \"You are not far from the kingdom of God.\" And after that no one dared to ask him any more questions.\n\n[35] And as Jesus taught in the temple, he said, \"How can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? [36] David himself, in the Holy Spirit, declared,\n\n\"'The Lord said to my Lord,\n\"Sit at my right hand,\nuntil I put your enemies under your feet.\"'\n\n[37] David himself calls him Lord. So how is he his son?\" And the great throng heard him gladly.\n\n[38] And in his teaching he said, \"Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes and like greetings in the marketplaces [39] and have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts, [40] who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.\"\n\n[41] And he sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting money into the offering box. Many rich people put in large sums. [42] And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which make a penny. [43] And he called his disciples to him and said to them, \"Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box. [44] For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on.\""
    ,"[1] And as he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, \"Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!\" [2] And Jesus said to him, \"Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.\"\n\n[3] And as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, [4] \"Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished?\" [5] And Jesus began to say to them, \"See that no one leads you astray. [6] Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he!' and they will lead many astray. [7] And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. This must take place, but the end is not yet. [8] For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. These are but the beginning of the birth pains.\n\n[9] \"But be on your guard. For they will deliver you over to councils, and you will be beaten in synagogues, and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them. [10] And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all nations. [11] And when they bring you to trial and deliver you over, do not be anxious beforehand what you are to say, but say whatever is given you in that hour, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit. [12] And brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death. [13] And you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.\n\n[14] \"But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where he ought not to be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. [15] Let the one who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter his house, to take anything out, [16] and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. [17] And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! [18] Pray that it may not happen in winter. [19] For in those days there will be such tribulation as has not been from the beginning of the creation that God created until now, and never will be. [20] And if the Lord had not cut short the days, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, whom he chose, he shortened the days. [21] And then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it. [22] For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform signs and wonders, to lead astray, if possible, the elect. [23] But be on guard; I have told you all things beforehand.\n\n[24] \"But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, [25] and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken. [26] And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. [27] And then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.\n\n[28] \"From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near. [29] So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that he is near, at the very gates. [30] Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. [31] Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.\n\n[32] \"But concerning that day or that hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. [33] Be on guard, keep awake. For you do not know when the time will come. [34] It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his servants in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to stay awake. [35] Therefore stay awakeâfor you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morningâ[36] lest he come suddenly and find you asleep. [37] And what I say to you I say to all: Stay awake.\""
    ,"[1] It was now two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest him by stealth and kill him, [2] for they said, \"Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar from the people.\"\n\n[3] And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he was reclining at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and she broke the flask and poured it over his head. [4] There were some who said to themselves indignantly, \"Why was the ointment wasted like that? [5] For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.\" And they scolded her. [6] But Jesus said, \"Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. [7] For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them. But you will not always have me. [8] She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burial. [9] And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.\"\n\n[10] Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them. [11] And when they heard it, they were glad and promised to give him money. And he sought an opportunity to betray him.\n\n[12] And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, \"Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?\" [13] And he sent two of his disciples and said to them, \"Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him, [14] and wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, 'The Teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' [15] And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; there prepare for us.\" [16] And the disciples set out and went to the city and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.\n\n[17] And when it was evening, he came with the twelve. [18] And as they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, \"Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.\" [19] They began to be sorrowful and to say to him one after another, \"Is it I?\" [20] He said to them, \"It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me. [21] For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.\"\n\n[22] And as they were eating, he took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, \"Take; this is my body.\" [23] And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. [24] And he said to them, \"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. [25] Truly, I say to you, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\"\n\n[26] And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. [27] And Jesus said to them, \"You will all fall away, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' [28] But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.\" [29] Peter said to him, \"Even though they all fall away, I will not.\" [30] And Jesus said to him, \"Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.\" [31] But he said emphatically, \"If I must die with you, I will not deny you.\" And they all said the same.\n\n[32] And they went to a place called Gethsemane. And he said to his disciples, \"Sit here while I pray.\" [33] And he took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly distressed and troubled. [34] And he said to them, \"My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch.\" [35] And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. [36] And he said, \"Abba, Father, all things are possible for you. Remove this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.\" [37] And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, \"Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour? [38] Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\" [39] And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words. [40] And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they did not know what to answer him. [41] And he came the third time and said to them, \"Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough; the hour has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. [42] Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.\"\n\n[43] And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. [44] Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, \"The one I will kiss is the man. Seize him and lead him away under guard.\" [45] And when he came, he went up to him at once and said, \"Rabbi!\" And he kissed him. [46] And they laid hands on him and seized him. [47] But one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. [48] And Jesus said to them, \"Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? [49] Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But let the Scriptures be fulfilled.\" [50] And they all left him and fled.\n\n[51] And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth about his body. And they seized him, [52] but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked.\n\n[53] And they led Jesus to the high priest. And all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together. [54] And Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he was sitting with the guards and warming himself at the fire. [55] Now the chief priests and the whole council were seeking testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but they found none. [56] For many bore false witness against him, but their testimony did not agree. [57] And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying, [58] \"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.'\" [59] Yet even about this their testimony did not agree. [60] And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, \"Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?\" [61] But he remained silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, \"Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?\" [62] And Jesus said, \"I am, and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.\" [63] And the high priest tore his garments and said, \"What further witnesses do we need? [64] You have heard his blasphemy. What is your decision?\" And they all condemned him as deserving death. [65] And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to strike him, saying to him, \"Prophesy!\" And the guards received him with blows.\n\n[66] And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came, [67] and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, \"You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.\" [68] But he denied it, saying, \"I neither know nor understand what you mean.\" And he went out into the gateway and the rooster crowed. [69] And the servant girl saw him and began again to say to the bystanders, \"This man is one of them.\" [70] But again he denied it. And after a little while the bystanders again said to Peter, \"Certainly you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.\" [71] But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, \"I do not know this man of whom you speak.\" [72] And immediately the rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him, \"Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.\" And he broke down and wept."
    ,"[1] And as soon as it was morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council. And they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate. [2] And Pilate asked him, \"Are you the King of the Jews?\" And he answered him, \"You have said so.\" [3] And the chief priests accused him of many things. [4] And Pilate again asked him, \"Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you.\" [5] But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed.\n\n[6] Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked. [7] And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas. [8] And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them. [9] And he answered them, saying, \"Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?\" [10] For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up. [11] But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead. [12] And Pilate again said to them, \"Then what shall I do with the man you call the King of the Jews?\" [13] And they cried out again, \"Crucify him.\" [14] And Pilate said to them, \"Why? What evil has he done?\" But they shouted all the more, \"Crucify him.\" [15] So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.\n\n[16] And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the governor's headquarters), and they called together the whole battalion. [17] And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on him. [18] And they began to salute him, \"Hail, King of the Jews!\" [19] And they were striking his head with a reed and spitting on him and kneeling down in homage to him. [20] And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him.\n\n[21] And they compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross. [22] And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull). [23] And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. [24] And they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take. [25] And it was the third hour when they crucified him. [26] And the inscription of the charge against him read, \"The King of the Jews.\" [27] And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left. [29] And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, \"Aha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, [30] save yourself, and come down from the cross!\" [31] So also the chief priests with the scribes mocked him to one another, saying, \"He saved others; he cannot save himself. [32] Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe.\" Those who were crucified with him also reviled him.\n\n[33] And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. [34] And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, \"Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?\" which means, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" [35] And some of the bystanders hearing it said, \"Behold, he is calling Elijah.\" [36] And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, \"Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.\" [37] And Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his last. [38] And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. [39] And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he breathed his last, he said, \"Truly this man was the Son of God!\"\n\n[40] There were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome. [41] When he was in Galilee, they followed him and ministered to him, and there were also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.\n\n[42] And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, [43] Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. [44] Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died. And summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead. [45] And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the corpse to Joseph. [46] And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. [47] Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid."
    ,"[1] When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him. [2] And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb. [3] And they were saying to one another, \"Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?\" [4] And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled backâit was very large. [5] And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed. [6] And he said to them, \"Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him. [7] But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.\" [8] And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them, and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.\n\n[Some of the earliest manuscripts do not include 16:9â20.]\n\n[9] [[Now when he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. [10] She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept. [11] But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it.\n\n[12] After these things he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country. [13] And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them.\n\n[14] Afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen. [15] And he said to them, \"Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. [16] Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. [17] And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; [18] they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.\"\n\n[19] So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. [20] And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by accompanying signs.]]"]
    ,"Luke":
        ["[1] Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things that have been accomplished among us, [2] just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word have delivered them to us, [3] it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely for some time past, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, [4] that you may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught.\n\n[5] In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah. And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. [6] And they were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord. [7] But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years.\n\n[8] Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty, [9] according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. [10] And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. [11] And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. [12] And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. [13] But the angel said to him, \"Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. [14] And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth, [15] for he will be great before the Lord. And he must not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb. [16] And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God, [17] and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.\"\n\n[18] And Zechariah said to the angel, \"How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.\" [19] And the angel answered him, \"I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. [20] And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.\" [21] And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple. [22] And when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them and remained mute. [23] And when his time of service was ended, he went to his home.\n\n[24] After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, saying, [25] \"Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.\"\n\n[26] In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, [27] to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. [28] And he came to her and said, \"Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!\" [29] But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be. [30] And the angel said to her, \"Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. [31] And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. [32] He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, [33] and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.\"\n\n[34] And Mary said to the angel, \"How will this be, since I am a virgin?\"\n\n[35] And the angel answered her, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holyâthe Son of God. [36] And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. [37] For nothing will be impossible with God.\" [38] And Mary said, \"Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.\" And the angel departed from her.\n\n[39] In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a town in Judah, [40] and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. [41] And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, [42] and she exclaimed with a loud cry, \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! [43] And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? [44] For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. [45] And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.\"\n\n[46] And Mary said,\n\n\"My soul magnifies the Lord, [47] and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, [48] for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant. For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed; [49] for he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name. [50] And his mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation. [51] He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts; [52] he has brought down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of humble estate; [53] he has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away empty. [54] He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy, [55] as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his offspring forever.\"\n\n[56] And Mary remained with her about three months and returned to her home.\n\n[57] Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son. [58] And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her. [59] And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. And they would have called him Zechariah after his father, [60] but his mother answered, \"No; he shall be called John.\" [61] And they said to her, \"None of your relatives is called by this name.\" [62] And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he wanted him to be called. [63] And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, \"His name is John.\" And they all wondered. [64] And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God. [65] And fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were talked about through all the hill country of Judea, [66] and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, \"What then will this child be?\" For the hand of the Lord was with him\n\n[67] And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,\n\n[68] \"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has visited and redeemed his people [69] and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David, [70] as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old, [71] that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us; [72] to show the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant, [73] the oath that he swore to our father Abraham, to grant us [74] that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve him without fear, [75] in holiness and righteousness before him all our days. [76] And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways, [77] to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the forgiveness of their sins, [78] because of the tender mercy of our God, whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high [79] to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.\"\n\n[80] And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel."
        ,"[1] In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. [2] This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. [3] And all went to be registered, each to his own town. [4] And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, [5] to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. [6] And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. [7] And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.\n\n[8] And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. [9] And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear. [10] And the angel said to them, \"Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. [11] For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. [12] And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.\" [13] And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,\n\n[14] \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!\"\n\n[15] When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, \"Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.\" [16] And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. [17] And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. [18] And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. [19] But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart. [20] And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.\n\n[21] And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.\n\n[22] And when the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord [23] (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, \"Every male who first opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord\") [24] and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord, \"a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.\" [25] Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. [26] And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. [27] And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law, [28] he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,\n\n[29] \"Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word;\n[30] for my eyes have seen your salvation\n[31] that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,\n[32] a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.\"\n\n[33] And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him. [34] And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, \"Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed [35] (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.\"\n\n[36] And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from when she was a virgin, [37] and then as a widow until she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day. [38] And coming up at that very hour she began to give thanks to God and to speak of him to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.\n\n[39] And when they had performed everything according to the Law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. [40] And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom. And the favor of God was upon him.\n\n[41] Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover. [42] And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom. [43] And when the feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it, [44] but supposing him to be in the group they went a day's journey, but then they began to search for him among their relatives and acquaintances, [45] and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching for him. [46] After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. [47] And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. [48] And when his parents saw him, they were astonished. And his mother said to him, \"Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress.\" [49] And he said to them, \"Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?\" [50] And they did not understand the saying that he spoke to them. [51] And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was submissive to them. And his mother treasured up all these things in her heart.\n\n[52] And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man."
        ,"[1] In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, [2] during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness. [3] And he went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. [4] As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,\n\n\"The voice of one crying in the wilderness:\n'Prepare the way of the Lord,\nmake his paths straight.\n[5] Every valley shall be filled,\nand every mountain and hill shall be made low,\nand the crooked shall become straight,\nand the rough places shall become level ways,\n[6] and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.'\"\n\n[7] He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, \"You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? [8] Bear fruits in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham. [9] Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.\"\n\n[10] And the crowds asked him, \"What then shall we do?\" [11] And he answered them, \"Whoever has two tunics is to share with him who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise.\" [12] Tax collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, \"Teacher, what shall we do?\" [13] And he said to them, \"Collect no more than you are authorized to do.\" [14] Soldiers also asked him, \"And we, what shall we do?\" And he said to them, \"Do not extort money from anyone by threats or by false accusation, and be content with your wages.\"\n\n[15] As the people were in expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Christ, [16] John answered them all, saying, \"I baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I is coming, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. [17] His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.\"\n\n[18] So with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people. [19] But Herod the tetrarch, who had been reproved by him for Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evil things that Herod had done, [20] added this to them all, that he locked up John in prison.\n\n[21] Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened, [22] and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove; and a voice came from heaven, \"You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.\"\n\n[23] Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli, [24] the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, [25] the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai, [26] the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda, [27] the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, [28] the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, [29] the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, [30] the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, [31] the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David, [32] the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Sala, the son of Nahshon, [33] the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Arni, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, [34] the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, [35] the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah, [36] the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, [37] the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan, [38] the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God."
        ,"[1] And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness [2] for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing during those days. And when they were ended, he was hungry. [3] The devil said to him, \"If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.\" [4] And Jesus answered him, \"It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone.'\" [5] And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, [6] and said to him, \"To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will. [7] If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.\" [8] And Jesus answered him, \"It is written,\n\n\"'You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.'\"\n\n[9] And he took him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, \"If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here, [10] for it is written,\n\n\"'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,'\n\n[11] and\n\n\"'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'\"\n\n[12] And Jesus answered him, \"It is said, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'\" [13] And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time.\n\n[14] And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and a report about him went out through all the surrounding country. [15] And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.\n\n[16] And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. And as was his custom, he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and he stood up to read. [17] And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written,\n\n[18] \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,\nbecause he has anointed me\nto proclaim good news to the poor.\nHe has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives\nand recovering of sight to the blind,\nto set at liberty those who are oppressed,\n[19] to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.\"\n\n[20] And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. [21] And he began to say to them, \"Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.\" [22] And all spoke well of him and marveled at the gracious words that were coming from his mouth. And they said, \"Is not this Joseph's son?\" [23] And he said to them, \"Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, '\"Physician, heal yourself.\" What we have heard you did at Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well.'\" [24] And he said, \"Truly, I say to you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown. [25] But in truth, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heavens were shut up three years and six months, and a great famine came over all the land, [26] and Elijah was sent to none of them but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. [27] And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.\" [28] When they heard these things, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath. [29] And they rose up and drove him out of the town and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff. [30] But passing through their midst, he went away.\n\n[31] And he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the Sabbath, [32] and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word possessed authority. [33] And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, [34] \"Ha! What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you areâthe Holy One of God.\" [35] But Jesus rebuked him, saying, \"Be silent and come out of him!\" And when the demon had thrown him down in their midst, he came out of him, having done him no harm. [36] And they were all amazed and said to one another, \"What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!\" [37] And reports about him went out into every place in the surrounding region.\n\n[38] And he arose and left the synagogue and entered Simon's house. Now Simon's mother-in-law was ill with a high fever, and they appealed to him on her behalf. [39] And he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her, and immediately she rose and began to serve them.\n\n[40] Now when the sun was setting, all those who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to him, and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them. [41] And demons also came out of many, crying, \"You are the Son of God!\" But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.\n\n[42] And when it was day, he departed and went into a desolate place. And the people sought him and came to him, and would have kept him from leaving them, [43] but he said to them, \"I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns as well; for I was sent for this purpose.\" [44] And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea."
        ,"[1] On one occasion, while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret, [2] and he saw two boats by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. [3] Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people from the boat. [4] And when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, \"Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.\" [5] And Simon answered, \"Master, we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.\" [6] And when they had done this, they enclosed a large number of fish, and their nets were breaking. [7] They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. [8] But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, \"Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.\" [9] For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken, [10] and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, \"Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.\" [11] And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.\n\n[12] While he was in one of the cities, there came a man full of leprosy. And when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, \"Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.\" [13] And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, \"I will; be clean.\" And immediately the leprosy left him. [14] And he charged him to tell no one, but \"go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a proof to them.\" [15] But now even more the report about him went abroad, and great crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities. [16] But he would withdraw to desolate places and pray.\n\n[17] On one of those days, as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with him to heal. [18] And behold, some men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and lay him before Jesus, [19] but finding no way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus. [20] And when he saw their faith, he said, \"Man, your sins are forgiven you.\" [21] And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, saying, \"Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?\" [22] When Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answered them, \"Why do you question in your hearts? [23] Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'? [24] But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\"âhe said to the man who was paralyzedâ\"I say to you, rise, pick up your bed and go home.\" [25] And immediately he rose up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went home, glorifying God. [26] And amazement seized them all, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, \"We have seen extraordinary things today.\"\n\n[27] After this he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi, sitting at the tax booth. And he said to him, \"Follow me.\" [28] And leaving everything, he rose and followed him.\n\n[29] And Levi made him a great feast in his house, and there was a large company of tax collectors and others reclining at table with them. [30] And the Pharisees and their scribes grumbled at his disciples, saying, \"Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?\" [31] And Jesus answered them, \"Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. [32] I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.\"\n\n[33] And they said to him, \"The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink.\" [34] And Jesus said to them, \"Can you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? [35] The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.\" [36] He also told them a parable: \"No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old garment. If he does, he will tear the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old. [37] And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed. [38] But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins. [39] And no one after drinking old wine desires new, for he says, 'The old is good.'\""
        ,"[1] On a Sabbath, while he was going through the grainfields, his disciples plucked and ate some heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands. [2] But some of the Pharisees said, \"Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?\" [3] And Jesus answered them, \"Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him: [4] how he entered the house of God and took and ate the bread of the Presence, which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those with him?\" [5] And he said to them, \"The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.\"\n\n[6] On another Sabbath, he entered the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was withered. [7] And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might find a reason to accuse him. [8] But he knew their thoughts, and he said to the man with the withered hand, \"Come and stand here.\" And he rose and stood there. [9] And Jesus said to them, \"I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to destroy it?\" [10] And after looking around at them all he said to him, \"Stretch out your hand.\" And he did so, and his hand was restored. [11] But they were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.\n\n[12] In these days he went out to the mountain to pray, and all night he continued in prayer to God. [13] And when day came, he called his disciples and chose from them twelve, whom he named apostles: [14] Simon, whom he named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip, and Bartholomew, [15] and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot, [16] and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.\n\n[17] And he came down with them and stood on a level place, with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, [18] who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. And those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured. [19] And all the crowd sought to touch him, for power came out from him and healed them all.\n\n[20] And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said:\n\n\"Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.\n\n[21] \"Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you shall be satisfied.\n\n\"Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh.\n\n[22] \"Blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as evil, on account of the Son of Man! [23] Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for so their fathers did to the prophets.\n\n[24] \"But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.\n\n[25] \"Woe to you who are full now, for you shall be hungry.\n\n\"Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep.\n\n[26] \"Woe to you, when all people speak well of you, for so their fathers did to the false prophets.\n\n[27] \"But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, [28] bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. [29] To one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also, and from one who takes away your cloak do not withhold your tunic either. [30] Give to everyone who begs from you, and from one who takes away your goods do not demand them back. [31] And as you wish that others would do to you, do so to them.\n\n[32] \"If you love those who love you, what benefit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. [33] And if you do good to those who do good to you, what benefit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. [34] And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to get back the same amount. [35] But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind to the ungrateful and the evil. [36] Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful.\n\n[37] \"Judge not, and you will not be judged; condemn not, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven; [38] give, and it will be given to you. Good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap. For with the measure you use it will be measured back to you.\"\n\n[39] He also told them a parable: \"Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit? [40] A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher. [41] Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? [42] How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye,' when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye.\n\n[43] \"For no good tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit, [44] for each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thornbushes, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush. [45] The good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure produces evil, for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.\n\n[46] \"Why do you call me 'Lord, Lord,' and not do what I tell you? [47] Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you what he is like: [48] he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built. [49] But the one who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the stream broke against it, immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.\""
        ,"[1] After he had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum. [2] Now a centurion had a servant who was sick and at the point of death, who was highly valued by him. [3] When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and heal his servant. [4] And when they came to Jesus, they pleaded with him earnestly, saying, \"He is worthy to have you do this for him, [5] for he loves our nation, and he is the one who built us our synagogue.\" [6] And Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to him, \"Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. [7] Therefore I did not presume to come to you. But say the word, and let my servant be healed. [8] For I too am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me: and I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.\" [9] When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turning to the crowd that followed him, said, \"I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.\" [10] And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant well.\n\n[11] Soon afterward he went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a great crowd went with him. [12] As he drew near to the gate of the town, behold, a man who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow, and a considerable crowd from the town was with her. [13] And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and said to her, \"Do not weep.\" [14] Then he came up and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. And he said, \"Young man, I say to you, arise.\" [15] And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother. [16] Fear seized them all, and they glorified God, saying, \"A great prophet has arisen among us!\" and \"God has visited his people!\" [17] And this report about him spread through the whole of Judea and all the surrounding country.\n\n[18] The disciples of John reported all these things to him. And John, [19] calling two of his disciples to him, sent them to the Lord, saying, \"Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?\" [20] And when the men had come to him, they said, \"John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, 'Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?'\" [21] In that hour he healed many people of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and on many who were blind he bestowed sight. [22] And he answered them, \"Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good news preached to them. [23] And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.\"\n\n[24] When John's messengers had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? [25] What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are dressed in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings' courts. [26] What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. [27] This is he of whom it is written,\n\n\"'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'\n\n[28] I tell you, among those born of women none is greater than John. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\" [29] (When all the people heard this, and the tax collectors too, they declared God just, having been baptized with the baptism of John, [30] but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.)\n\n[31] \"To what then shall I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like? [32] They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another,\n\n\"'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.'\n\n[33] For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.' [34] The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' [35] Yet wisdom is justified by all her children.\"\n\n[36] One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee's house and reclined at table. [37] And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment, [38] and standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment. [39] Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, \"If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner.\" [40] And Jesus answering said to him, \"Simon, I have something to say to you.\" And he answered, \"Say it, Teacher.\"\n\n[41] \"A certain moneylender had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. [42] When they could not pay, he cancelled the debt of both. Now which of them will love him more?\" [43] Simon answered, \"The one, I suppose, for whom he cancelled the larger debt.\" And he said to him, \"You have judged rightly.\" [44] Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon, \"Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. [45] You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet. [46] You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. [47] Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgivenâfor she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little.\" [48] And he said to her, \"Your sins are forgiven.\" [49] Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves, \"Who is this, who even forgives sins?\" [50] And he said to the woman, \"Your faith has saved you; go in peace.\""
        ,"[1] Soon afterward he went on through cities and villages, proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with him, [2] and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, [3] and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's household manager, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their means.\n\n[4] And when a great crowd was gathering and people from town after town came to him, he said in a parable, [5] \"A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell along the path and was trampled underfoot, and the birds of the air devoured it. [6] And some fell on the rock, and as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture. [7] And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it. [8] And some fell into good soil and grew and yielded a hundredfold.\" As he said these things, he called out, \"He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\"\n\n[9] And when his disciples asked him what this parable meant, [10] he said, \"To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God, but for others they are in parables, so that 'seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.' [11] Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. [12] The ones along the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. [13] And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy. But these have no root; they believe for a while, and in time of testing fall away. [14] And as for what fell among the thorns, they are those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature. [15] As for that in the good soil, they are those who, hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and bear fruit with patience.\n\n[16] \"No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light. [17] For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light. [18] Take care then how you hear, for to the one who has, more will be given, and from the one who has not, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away.\"\n\n[19] Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not reach him because of the crowd. [20] And he was told, \"Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you.\" [21] But he answered them, \"My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.\"\n\n[22] One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, \"Let us go across to the other side of the lake.\" So they set out, [23] and as they sailed he fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water and were in danger. [24] And they went and woke him, saying, \"Master, Master, we are perishing!\" And he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves, and they ceased, and there was a calm. [25] He said to them, \"Where is your faith?\" And they were afraid, and they marveled, saying to one another, \"Who then is this, that he commands even winds and water, and they obey him?\"\n\n[26] Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee. [27] When Jesus had stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he had not lived in a house but among the tombs. [28] When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him and said with a loud voice, \"What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me.\" [29] For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many a time it had seized him. He was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert.) [30] Jesus then asked him, \"What is your name?\" And he said, \"Legion,\" for many demons had entered him. [31] And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss. [32] Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him to let them enter these. So he gave them permission. [33] Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.\n\n[34] When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country. [35] Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. [36] And those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been healed. [37] Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned. [38] The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, [39] \"Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you.\" And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.\n\n[40] Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him. [41] And there came a man named Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue. And falling at Jesus' feet, he implored him to come to his house, [42] for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying.\n\nAs Jesus went, the people pressed around him. [43] And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and though she had spent all her living on physicians, she could not be healed by anyone. [44] She came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment, and immediately her discharge of blood ceased. [45] And Jesus said, \"Who was it that touched me?\" When all denied it, Peter said, \"Master, the crowds surround you and are pressing in on you!\" [46] But Jesus said, \"Someone touched me, for I perceive that power has gone out from me.\" [47] And when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed. [48] And he said to her, \"Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.\"\n\n[49] While he was still speaking, someone from the ruler's house came and said, \"Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any more.\" [50] But Jesus on hearing this answered him, \"Do not fear; only believe, and she will be well.\" [51] And when he came to the house, he allowed no one to enter with him, except Peter and John and James, and the father and mother of the child. [52] And all were weeping and mourning for her, but he said, \"Do not weep, for she is not dead but sleeping.\" [53] And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. [54] But taking her by the hand he called, saying, \"Child, arise.\" [55] And her spirit returned, and she got up at once. And he directed that something should be given her to eat. [56] And her parents were amazed, but he charged them to tell no one what had happened."
    ,"[1] And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases, [2] and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal. [3] And he said to them, \"Take nothing for your journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics. [4] And whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart. [5] And wherever they do not receive you, when you leave that town shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.\" [6] And they departed and went through the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.\n\n[7] Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead, [8] by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen. [9] Herod said, \"John I beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?\" And he sought to see him.\n\n[10] On their return the apostles told him all that they had done. And he took them and withdrew apart to a town called Bethsaida. [11] When the crowds learned it, they followed him, and he welcomed them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God and cured those who had need of healing. [12] Now the day began to wear away, and the twelve came and said to him, \"Send the crowd away to go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and get provisions, for we are here in a desolate place.\" [13] But he said to them, \"You give them something to eat.\" They said, \"We have no more than five loaves and two fishâunless we are to go and buy food for all these people.\" [14] For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, \"Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.\" [15] And they did so, and had them all sit down. [16] And taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing over them. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd. [17] And they all ate and were satisfied. And what was left over was picked up, twelve baskets of broken pieces.\n\n[18] Now it happened that as he was praying alone, the disciples were with him. And he asked them, \"Who do the crowds say that I am?\" [19] And they answered, \"John the Baptist. But others say, Elijah, and others, that one of the prophets of old has risen.\" [20] Then he said to them, \"But who do you say that I am?\" And Peter answered, \"The Christ of God.\"\n\n[21] And he strictly charged and commanded them to tell this to no one, [22] saying, \"The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.\"\n\n[23] And he said to all, \"If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. [24] For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. [25] For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself? [26] For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. [27] But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.\"\n\n[28] Now about eight days after these sayings he took with him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray. [29] And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became dazzling white. [30] And behold, two men were talking with him, Moses and Elijah, [31] who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. [32] Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they became fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. [33] And as the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, \"Master, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah\"ânot knowing what he said. [34] As he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. [35] And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, \"This is my Son, my Chosen One; listen to him!\" [36] And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.\n\n[37] On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him. [38] And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, \"Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child. [39] And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out. It convulses him so that he foams at the mouth, and shatters him, and will hardly leave him. [40] And I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.\" [41] Jesus answered, \"O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.\" [42] While he was coming, the demon threw him to the ground and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. [43] And all were astonished at the majesty of God.\n\nBut while they were all marveling at everything he was doing, Jesus said to his disciples, [44] \"Let these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.\" [45] But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them, so that they might not perceive it. And they were afraid to ask him about this saying.\n\n[46] An argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest. [47] But Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a child and put him by his side [48] and said to them, \"Whoever receives this child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For he who is least among you all is the one who is great.\"\n\n[49] John answered, \"Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not follow with us.\" [50] But Jesus said to him, \"Do not stop him, for the one who is not against you is for you.\"\n\n[51] When the days drew near for him to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem. [52] And he sent messengers ahead of him, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make preparations for him. [53] But the people did not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem. [54] And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, \"Lord, do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them?\" [55] But he turned and rebuked them. [56] And they went on to another village.\n\n[57] As they were going along the road, someone said to him, \"I will follow you wherever you go.\" [58] And Jesus said to him, \"Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\" [59] To another he said, \"Follow me.\" But he said, \"Lord, let me first go and bury my father.\" [60] And Jesus said to him, \"Leave the dead to bury their own dead. But as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.\" [61] Yet another said, \"I will follow you, Lord, but let me first say farewell to those at my home.\" [62] Jesus said to him, \"No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.\""
    ,"[1] After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them on ahead of him, two by two, into every town and place where he himself was about to go. [2] And he said to them, \"The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. [3] Go your way; behold, I am sending you out as lambs in the midst of wolves. [4] Carry no moneybag, no knapsack, no sandals, and greet no one on the road. [5] Whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace be to this house!' [6] And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him. But if not, it will return to you. [7] And remain in the same house, eating and drinking what they provide, for the laborer deserves his wages. Do not go from house to house. [8] Whenever you enter a town and they receive you, eat what is set before you. [9] Heal the sick in it and say to them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.' [10] But whenever you enter a town and they do not receive you, go into its streets and say, [11] 'Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near.' [12] I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.\n\n[13] \"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. [14] But it will be more bearable in the judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you. [15] And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades.\n\n[16] \"The one who hears you hears me, and the one who rejects you rejects me, and the one who rejects me rejects him who sent me.\"\n\n[17] The seventy-two returned with joy, saying, \"Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!\" [18] And he said to them, \"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. [19] Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you. [20] Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\"\n\n[21] In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, \"I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will. [22] All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.\"\n\n[23] Then turning to the disciples he said privately, \"Blessed are the eyes that see what you see! [24] For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.\"\n\n[25] And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, \"Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\" [26] He said to him, \"What is written in the Law? How do you read it?\" [27] And he answered, \"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.\" [28] And he said to him, \"You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.\"\n\n[29] But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, \"And who is my neighbor?\" [30] Jesus replied, \"A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead. [31] Now by chance a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him he passed by on the other side. [32] So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. [33] But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion. [34] He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him. [35] And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, 'Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.' [36] Which of these three, do you think, proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?\" [37] He said, \"The one who showed him mercy.\" And Jesus said to him, \"You go, and do likewise.\"\n\n[38] Now as they went on their way, Jesus entered a village. And a woman named Martha welcomed him into her house. [39] And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching. [40] But Martha was distracted with much serving. And she went up to him and said, \"Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me.\" [41] But the Lord answered her, \"Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things, [42] but one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken away from her.\""
    ,"[1] Now Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when he finished, one of his disciples said to him, \"Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.\" [2] And he said to them, \"When you pray, say:\n\n\"Father, hallowed be your name.\nYour kingdom come.\n[3] Give us each day our daily bread,\n[4] and forgive us our sins,\nfor we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us.\nAnd lead us not into temptation.\"\n\n[5] And he said to them, \"Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves, [6] for a friend of mine has arrived on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him'; [7] and he will answer from within, 'Do not bother me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything'? [8] I tell you, though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his impudence he will rise and give him whatever he needs. [9] And I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. [10] For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. [11] What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent; [12] or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? [13] If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!\"\n\n[14] Now he was casting out a demon that was mute. When the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke, and the people marveled. [15] But some of them said, \"He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of demons,\" [16] while others, to test him, kept seeking from him a sign from heaven. [17] But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, \"Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a divided household falls. [18] And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul. [19] And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. [20] But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. [21] When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his goods are safe; [22] but when one stronger than he attacks him and overcomes him, he takes away his armor in which he trusted and divides his spoil. [23] Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.\n\n[24] \"When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and finding none it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' [25] And when it comes, it finds the house swept and put in order. [26] Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there. And the last state of that person is worse than the first.\"\n\n[27] As he said these things, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, \"Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts at which you nursed!\" [28] But he said, \"Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!\"\n\n[29] When the crowds were increasing, he began to say, \"This generation is an evil generation. It seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. [30] For as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation. [31] The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here. [32] The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.\n\n[33] \"No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light. [34] Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is full of light, but when it is bad, your body is full of darkness. [35] Therefore be careful lest the light in you be darkness. [36] If then your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly bright, as when a lamp with its rays gives you light.\"\n\n[37] While Jesus was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him, so he went in and reclined at table. [38] The Pharisee was astonished to see that he did not first wash before dinner. [39] And the Lord said to him, \"Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. [40] You fools! Did not he who made the outside make the inside also? [41] But give as alms those things that are within, and behold, everything is clean for you.\n\n[42] \"But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, and neglect justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others. [43] Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seat in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces. [44] Woe to you! For you are like unmarked graves, and people walk over them without knowing it.\"\n\n[45] One of the lawyers answered him, \"Teacher, in saying these things you insult us also.\" [46] And he said, \"Woe to you lawyers also! For you load people with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers. [47] Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets whom your fathers killed. [48] So you are witnesses and you consent to the deeds of your fathers, for they killed them, and you build their tombs. [49] Therefore also the Wisdom of God said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute,' [50] so that the blood of all the prophets, shed from the foundation of the world, may be charged against this generation, [51] from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation. [52] Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge. You did not enter yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering.\"\n\n[53] As he went away from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press him hard and to provoke him to speak about many things, [54] lying in wait for him, to catch him in something he might say."
    ,"[1] In the meantime, when so many thousands of the people had gathered together that they were trampling one another, he began to say to his disciples first, \"Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. [2] Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. [3] Therefore whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in private rooms shall be proclaimed on the housetops.\n\n[4] \"I tell you, my friends, do not fear those who kill the body, and after that have nothing more that they can do. [5] But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to cast into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him! [6] Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten before God. [7] Why, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; you are of more value than many sparrows.\n\n[8] \"And I tell you, everyone who acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man also will acknowledge before the angels of God, [9] but the one who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God. [10] And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but the one who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. [11] And when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not be anxious about how you should defend yourself or what you should say, [12] for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.\"\n\n[13] Someone in the crowd said to him, \"Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.\" [14] But he said to him, \"Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?\" [15] And he said to them, \"Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.\" [16] And he told them a parable, saying, \"The land of a rich man produced plentifully, [17] and he thought to himself, 'What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?' [18] And he said, 'I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. [19] And I will say to my soul, \"Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.\"' [20] But God said to him, 'Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?' [21] So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.\"\n\n[22] And he said to his disciples, \"Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat, nor about your body, what you will put on. [23] For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing. [24] Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds! [25] And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? [26] If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that, why are you anxious about the rest? [27] Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. [28] But if God so clothes the grass, which is alive in the field today, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith! [29] And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, nor be worried. [30] For all the nations of the world seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need them. [31] Instead, seek his kingdom, and these things will be added to you.\n\n[32] \"Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. [33] Sell your possessions, and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. [34] For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\n\n[35] \"Stay dressed for action and keep your lamps burning, [36] and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast, so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and knocks. [37] Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will dress himself for service and have them recline at table, and he will come and serve them. [38] If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them awake, blessed are those servants! [39] But know this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have left his house to be broken into. [40] You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.\"\n\n[41] Peter said, \"Lord, are you telling this parable for us or for all?\" [42] And the Lord said, \"Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom his master will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the proper time? [43] Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes. [44] Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. [45] But if that servant says to himself, 'My master is delayed in coming,' and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and get drunk, [46] the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces and put him with the unfaithful. [47] And that servant who knew his master's will but did not get ready or act according to his will, will receive a severe beating. [48] But the one who did not know, and did what deserved a beating, will receive a light beating. Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more.\n\n[49] \"I came to cast fire on the earth, and would that it were already kindled! [50] I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how great is my distress until it is accomplished! [51] Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division. [52] For from now on in one house there will be five divided, three against two and two against three. [53] They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.\"\n\n[54] He also said to the crowds, \"When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say at once, 'A shower is coming.' And so it happens. [55] And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, 'There will be scorching heat,' and it happens. [56] You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky, but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?\n\n[57] \"And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right? [58] As you go with your accuser before the magistrate, make an effort to settle with him on the way, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer put you in prison. [59] I tell you, you will never get out until you have paid the very last penny.\""
    ,"[1] There were some present at that very time who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. [2] And he answered them, \"Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered in this way? [3] No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. [4] Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them: do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem? [5] No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.\"\n\n[6] And he told this parable: \"A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none. [7] And he said to the vinedresser, 'Look, for three years now I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I find none. Cut it down. Why should it use up the ground?' [8] And he answered him, 'Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and put on manure. [9] Then if it should bear fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down.'\"\n\n[10] Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. [11] And behold, there was a woman who had had a disabling spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not fully straighten herself. [12] When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said to her, \"Woman, you are freed from your disability.\" [13] And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and she glorified God. [14] But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the people, \"There are six days in which work ought to be done. Come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.\" [15] Then the Lord answered him, \"You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to water it? [16] And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?\" [17] As he said these things, all his adversaries were put to shame, and all the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him.\n\n[18] He said therefore, \"What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it? [19] It is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his garden, and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air made nests in its branches.\"\n\n[20] And again he said, \"To what shall I compare the kingdom of God? [21] It is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened.\"\n\n[22] He went on his way through towns and villages, teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem. [23] And someone said to him, \"Lord, will those who are saved be few?\" And he said to them, [24] \"Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able. [25] When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, open to us,' then he will answer you, 'I do not know where you come from.' [26] Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.' [27] But he will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of evil!' [28] In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves cast out. [29] And people will come from east and west, and from north and south, and recline at table in the kingdom of God. [30] And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.\"\n\n[31] At that very hour some Pharisees came and said to him, \"Get away from here, for Herod wants to kill you.\" [32] And he said to them, \"Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I finish my course. [33] Nevertheless, I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the day following, for it cannot be that a prophet should perish away from Jerusalem.' [34] O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing! [35] Behold, your house is forsaken. And I tell you, you will not see me until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'\""
    ,"[1] One Sabbath, when he went to dine at the house of a ruler of the Pharisees, they were watching him carefully. [2] And behold, there was a man before him who had dropsy. [3] And Jesus responded to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, \"Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?\" [4] But they remained silent. Then he took him and healed him and sent him away. [5] And he said to them, \"Which of you, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day, will not immediately pull him out?\" [6] And they could not reply to these things.\n\n[7] Now he told a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the places of honor, saying to them, [8] \"When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in a place of honor, lest someone more distinguished than you be invited by him, [9] and he who invited you both will come and say to you, 'Give your place to this person,' and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place. [10] But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when your host comes he may say to you, 'Friend, move up higher.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you. [11] For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.\"\n\n[12] He said also to the man who had invited him, \"When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and you be repaid. [13] But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, [14] and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.\"\n\n[15] When one of those who reclined at table with him heard these things, he said to him, \"Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!\" [16] But he said to him, \"A man once gave a great banquet and invited many. [17] And at the time for the banquet he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited, 'Come, for everything is now ready.' [18] But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, 'I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it. Please have me excused.' [19] And another said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to examine them. Please have me excused.' [20] And another said, 'I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.' [21] So the servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house became angry and said to his servant, 'Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor and crippled and blind and lame.' [22] And the servant said, 'Sir, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.' [23] And the master said to the servant, 'Go out to the highways and hedges and compel people to come in, that my house may be filled. [24] For I tell you, none of those men who were invited shall taste my banquet.'\"\n\n[25] Now great crowds accompanied him, and he turned and said to them, [26] \"If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple. [27] Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple. [28] For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it? [29] Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him, [30] saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.' [31] Or what king, going out to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? [32] And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace. [33] So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.\n\n[34] \"Salt is good, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? [35] It is of no use either for the soil or for the manure pile. It is thrown away. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\""
    ,"[1] Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him. [2] And the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled, saying, \"This man receives sinners and eats with them.\"\n\n[3] So he told them this parable: [4] \"What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open country, and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it? [5] And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. [6] And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.' [7] Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.\n\n[8] \"Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it? [9] And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.' [10] Just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.\"\n\n[11] And he said, \"There was a man who had two sons. [12] And the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of property that is coming to me.' And he divided his property between them. [13] Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in reckless living. [14] And when he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in need. [15] So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. [16] And he was longing to be fed with the pods that the pigs ate, and no one gave him anything.\n\n[17] \"But when he came to himself, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger! [18] I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, \"Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. [19] I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat me as one of your hired servants.\"' [20] And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. [21] And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.' [22] But the father said to his servants, 'Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet. [23] And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate. [24] For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.' And they began to celebrate.\n\n[25] \"Now his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. [26] And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant. [27] And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.' [28] But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him, [29] but he answered his father, 'Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might celebrate with my friends. [30] But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!' [31] And he said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. [32] It was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.'\""
    ,"[1] He also said to the disciples, \"There was a rich man who had a manager, and charges were brought to him that this man was wasting his possessions. [2] And he called him and said to him, 'What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the account of your management, for you can no longer be manager.' [3] And the manager said to himself, 'What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. [4] I have decided what to do, so that when I am removed from management, people may receive me into their houses.' [5] So, summoning his master's debtors one by one, he said to the first, 'How much do you owe my master?' [6] He said, 'A hundred measures of oil.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.' [7] Then he said to another, 'And how much do you owe?' He said, 'A hundred measures of wheat.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.' [8] The master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewdness. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light. [9] And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.\n\n[10] \"One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much. [11] If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches? [12] And if you have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own? [13] No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.\"\n\n[14] The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they ridiculed him. [15] And he said to them, \"You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.\n\n[16] \"The Law and the Prophets were until John; since then the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone forces his way into it. [17] But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to become void.\n\n[18] \"Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.\n\n[19] \"There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. [20] And at his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, [21] who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores. [22] The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried, [23] and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side. [24] And he called out, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.' [25] But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. [26] And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.' [27] And he said, 'Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father's houseâ[28] for I have five brothersâso that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.' [29] But Abraham said, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.' [30] And he said, 'No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.' [31] He said to him, 'If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.'\""
    ,"[1] And he said to his disciples, \"Temptations to sin are sure to come, but woe to the one through whom they come! [2] It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin. [3] Pay attention to yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him, [4] and if he sins against you seven times in the day, and turns to you seven times, saying, 'I repent,' you must forgive him.\"\n\n[5] The apostles said to the Lord, \"Increase our faith!\" [6] And the Lord said, \"If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it would obey you.\n\n[7] \"Will any one of you who has a servant plowing or keeping sheep say to him when he has come in from the field, 'Come at once and recline at table'? [8] Will he not rather say to him, 'Prepare supper for me, and dress properly, and serve me while I eat and drink, and afterward you will eat and drink'? [9] Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded? [10] So you also, when you have done all that you were commanded, say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty.'\"\n\n[11] On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee. [12] And as he entered a village, he was met by ten lepers, who stood at a distance [13] and lifted up their voices, saying, \"Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.\" [14] When he saw them he said to them, \"Go and show yourselves to the priests.\" And as they went they were cleansed. [15] Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice; [16] and he fell on his face at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan. [17] Then Jesus answered, \"Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine? [18] Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?\" [19] And he said to him, \"Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well.\"\n\n[20] Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them, \"The kingdom of God is not coming in ways that can be observed, [21] nor will they say, 'Look, here it is!' or 'There!' for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.\"\n\n[22] And he said to the disciples, \"The days are coming when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it. [23] And they will say to you, 'Look, there!' or 'Look, here!' Do not go out or follow them. [24] For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his day. [25] But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. [26] Just as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of Man. [27] They were eating and drinking and marrying and being given in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. [28] Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lotâthey were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building, [29] but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom, fire and sulfur rained from heaven and destroyed them allâ[30] so will it be on the day when the Son of Man is revealed. [31] On that day, let the one who is on the housetop, with his goods in the house, not come down to take them away, and likewise let the one who is in the field not turn back. [32] Remember Lot's wife. [33] Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will keep it. [34] I tell you, in that night there will be two in one bed. One will be taken and the other left. [35] There will be two women grinding together. One will be taken and the other left.\" [37] And they said to him, \"Where, Lord?\" He said to them, \"Where the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.\""
    ,"[1] And he told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart. [2] He said, \"In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected man. [3] And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, 'Give me justice against my adversary.' [4] For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself, 'Though I neither fear God nor respect man, [5] yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will give her justice, so that she will not beat me down by her continual coming.'\" [6] And the Lord said, \"Hear what the unrighteous judge says. [7] And will not God give justice to his elect, who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them? [8] I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?\"\n\n[9] He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt: [10] \"Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. [11] The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. [12] I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.' [13] But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner!' [14] I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.\"\n\n[15] Now they were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them. And when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. [16] But Jesus called them to him, saying, \"Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. [17] Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.\"\n\n[18] And a ruler asked him, \"Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" [19] And Jesus said to him, \"Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. [20] You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.'\" [21] And he said, \"All these I have kept from my youth.\" [22] When Jesus heard this, he said to him, \"One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.\" [23] But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich. [24] Jesus, seeing that he had become sad, said, \"How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! [25] For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.\" [26] Those who heard it said, \"Then who can be saved?\" [27] But he said, \"What is impossible with man is possible with God.\" [28] And Peter said, \"See, we have left our homes and followed you.\" [29] And he said to them, \"Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, [30] who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life.\"\n\n[31] And taking the twelve, he said to them, \"See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished. [32] For he will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon. [33] And after flogging him, they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise.\" [34] But they understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what was said.\n\n[35] As he drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. [36] And hearing a crowd going by, he inquired what this meant. [37] They told him, \"Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.\" [38] And he cried out, \"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!\" [39] And those who were in front rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, \"Son of David, have mercy on me!\" [40] And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him, [41] \"What do you want me to do for you?\" He said, \"Lord, let me recover my sight.\" [42] And Jesus said to him, \"Recover your sight; your faith has made you well.\" [43] And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God."
    ,"[1] He entered Jericho and was passing through. [2] And behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector and was rich. [3] And he was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was small in stature. [4] So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was about to pass that way. [5] And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, \"Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today.\" [6] So he hurried and came down and received him joyfully. [7] And when they saw it, they all grumbled, \"He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.\" [8] And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, \"Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold.\" [9] And Jesus said to him, \"Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham. [10] For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.\"\n\n[11] As they heard these things, he proceeded to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately. [12] He said therefore, \"A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return. [13] Calling ten of his servants, he gave them ten minas, and said to them, 'Engage in business until I come.' [14] But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We do not want this man to reign over us.' [15] When he returned, having received the kingdom, he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by doing business. [16] The first came before him, saying, 'Lord, your mina has made ten minas more.' [17] And he said to him, 'Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.' [18] And the second came, saying, 'Lord, your mina has made five minas.' [19] And he said to him, 'And you are to be over five cities.' [20] Then another came, saying, 'Lord, here is your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief; [21] for I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man. You take what you did not deposit, and reap what you did not sow.' [22] He said to him, 'I will condemn you with your own words, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a severe man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow? [23] Why then did you not put my money in the bank, and at my coming I might have collected it with interest?' [24] And he said to those who stood by, 'Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas.' [25] And they said to him, 'Lord, he has ten minas!' [26] 'I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. [27] But as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slaughter them before me.'\"\n\n[28] And when he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. [29] When he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples, [30] saying, \"Go into the village in front of you, where on entering you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever yet sat. Untie it and bring it here. [31] If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' you shall say this: 'The Lord has need of it.'\" [32] So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them. [33] And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, \"Why are you untying the colt?\" [34] And they said, \"The Lord has need of it.\" [35] And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks on the colt, they set Jesus on it. [36] And as he rode along, they spread their cloaks on the road. [37] As he was drawing nearâalready on the way down the Mount of Olivesâthe whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen, [38] saying, \"Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!\" [39] And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, \"Teacher, rebuke your disciples.\" [40] He answered, \"I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.\"\n\n[41] And when he drew near and saw the city, he wept over it, [42] saying, \"Would that you, even you, had known on this day the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes. [43] For the days will come upon you, when your enemies will set up a barricade around you and surround you and hem you in on every side [44] and tear you down to the ground, you and your children within you. And they will not leave one stone upon another in you, because you did not know the time of your visitation.\"\n\n[45] And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold, [46] saying to them, \"It is written, 'My house shall be a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of robbers.\"\n\n[47] And he was teaching daily in the temple. The chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people were seeking to destroy him, [48] but they did not find anything they could do, for all the people were hanging on his words."
    ,"[1] One day, as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came up [2] and said to him, \"Tell us by what authority you do these things, or who it is that gave you this authority.\" [3] He answered them, \"I also will ask you a question. Now tell me, [4] was the baptism of John from heaven or from man?\" [5] And they discussed it with one another, saying, \"If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why did you not believe him?' [6] But if we say, 'From man,' all the people will stone us to death, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.\" [7] So they answered that they did not know where it came from. [8] And Jesus said to them, \"Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\"\n\n[9] And he began to tell the people this parable: \"A man planted a vineyard and let it out to tenants and went into another country for a long while. [10] When the time came, he sent a servant to the tenants, so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed. [11] And he sent another servant. But they also beat and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed. [12] And he sent yet a third. This one also they wounded and cast out. [13] Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.' [14] But when the tenants saw him, they said to themselves, 'This is the heir. Let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.' [15] And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? [16] He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.\" When they heard this, they said, \"Surely not!\" [17] But he looked directly at them and said, \"What then is this that is written:\n\n\"'The stone that the builders rejected\nhas become the cornerstone'?\n\n[18] Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.\"\n\n[19] The scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him at that very hour, for they perceived that he had told this parable against them, but they feared the people. [20] So they watched him and sent spies, who pretended to be sincere, that they might catch him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor. [21] So they asked him, \"Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and show no partiality, but truly teach the way of God. [22] Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?\" [23] But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, [24] \"Show me a denarius. Whose likeness and inscription does it have?\" They said, \"Caesar's.\" [25] He said to them, \"Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\" [26] And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him in what he said, but marveling at his answer they became silent.\n\n[27] There came to him some Sadducees, those who deny that there is a resurrection, [28] and they asked him a question, saying, \"Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies, having a wife but no children, the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. [29] Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died without children. [30] And the second [31] and the third took her, and likewise all seven left no children and died. [32] Afterward the woman also died. [33] In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had her as wife.\"\n\n[34] And Jesus said to them, \"The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage, [35] but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage, [36] for they cannot die anymore, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. [37] But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. [38] Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him.\" [39] Then some of the scribes answered, \"Teacher, you have spoken well.\" [40] For they no longer dared to ask him any question.\n\n[41] But he said to them, \"How can they say that the Christ is David's son? [42] For David himself says in the Book of Psalms,\n\n\"'The Lord said to my Lord,\n\"Sit at my right hand,\n[43] until I make your enemies your footstool.\"'\n\n[44] David thus calls him Lord, so how is he his son?\"\n\n[45] And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples, [46] \"Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts, [47] who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.\""
    ,"[1] Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the offering box, [2] and he saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins. [3] And he said, \"Truly, I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them. [4] For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on.\"\n\n[5] And while some were speaking of the temple, how it was adorned with noble stones and offerings, he said, [6] \"As for these things that you see, the days will come when there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.\" [7] And they asked him, \"Teacher, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?\" [8] And he said, \"See that you are not led astray. For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he!' and, 'The time is at hand!' Do not go after them. [9] And when you hear of wars and tumults, do not be terrified, for these things must first take place, but the end will not be at once.\"\n\n[10] Then he said to them, \"Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. [11] There will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences. And there will be terrors and great signs from heaven. [12] But before all this they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors for my name's sake. [13] This will be your opportunity to bear witness. [14] Settle it therefore in your minds not to meditate beforehand how to answer, [15] for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict. [16] You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and some of you they will put to death. [17] You will be hated by all for my name's sake. [18] But not a hair of your head will perish. [19] By your endurance you will gain your lives.\n\n[20] \"But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near. [21] Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are inside the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it, [22] for these are days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written. [23] Alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! For there will be great distress upon the earth and wrath against this people. [24] They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive among all nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.\n\n[25] \"And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity because of the roaring of the sea and the waves, [26] people fainting with fear and with foreboding of what is coming on the world. For the powers of the heavens will be shaken. [27] And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. [28] Now when these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.\"\n\n[29] And he told them a parable: \"Look at the fig tree, and all the trees. [30] As soon as they come out in leaf, you see for yourselves and know that the summer is already near. [31] So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near. [32] Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all has taken place. [33] Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.\n\n[34] \"But watch yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly like a trap. [35] For it will come upon all who dwell on the face of the whole earth. [36] But stay awake at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.\"\n\n[37] And every day he was teaching in the temple, but at night he went out and lodged on the mount called Olivet. [38] And early in the morning all the people came to him in the temple to hear him."
    ,"[1] Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called the Passover. [2] And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to put him to death, for they feared the people.\n\n[3] Then Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve. [4] He went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers how he might betray him to them. [5] And they were glad, and agreed to give him money. [6] So he consented and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of a crowd.\n\n[7] Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. [8] So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, \"Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat it.\" [9] They said to him, \"Where will you have us prepare it?\" [10] He said to them, \"Behold, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters [11] and tell the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' [12] And he will show you a large upper room furnished; prepare it there.\" [13] And they went and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.\n\n[14] And when the hour came, he reclined at table, and the apostles with him. [15] And he said to them, \"I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. [16] For I tell you I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.\" [17] And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he said, \"Take this, and divide it among yourselves. [18] For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\" [19] And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, \"This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.\" [20] And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, \"This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. [21] But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table. [22] For the Son of Man goes as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!\" [23] And they began to question one another, which of them it could be who was going to do this.\n\n[24] A dispute also arose among them, as to which of them was to be regarded as the greatest. [25] And he said to them, \"The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those in authority over them are called benefactors. [26] But not so with you. Rather, let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves. [27] For who is the greater, one who reclines at table or one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am among you as the one who serves.\n\n[28] \"You are those who have stayed with me in my trials, [29] and I assign to you, as my Father assigned to me, a kingdom, [30] that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\n\n[31] \"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, [32] but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.\" [33] Peter said to him, \"Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death.\" [34] Jesus said, \"I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day, until you deny three times that you know me.\"\n\n[35] And he said to them, \"When I sent you out with no moneybag or knapsack or sandals, did you lack anything?\" They said, \"Nothing.\" [36] He said to them, \"But now let the one who has a moneybag take it, and likewise a knapsack. And let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one. [37] For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors.' For what is written about me has its fulfillment.\" [38] And they said, \"Look, Lord, here are two swords.\" And he said to them, \"It is enough.\"\n\n[39] And he came out and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him. [40] And when he came to the place, he said to them, \"Pray that you may not enter into temptation.\" [41] And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and knelt down and prayed, [42] saying, \"Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.\" [43] And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. [44] And being in agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground. [45] And when he rose from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow, [46] and he said to them, \"Why are you sleeping? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.\"\n\n[47] While he was still speaking, there came a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss him, [48] but Jesus said to him, \"Judas, would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?\" [49] And when those who were around him saw what would follow, they said, \"Lord, shall we strike with the sword?\" [50] And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. [51] But Jesus said, \"No more of this!\" And he touched his ear and healed him. [52] Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders, who had come out against him, \"Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? [53] When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.\"\n\n[54] Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest's house, and Peter was following at a distance. [55] And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them. [56] Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely at him, said, \"This man also was with him.\" [57] But he denied it, saying, \"Woman, I do not know him.\" [58] And a little later someone else saw him and said, \"You also are one of them.\" But Peter said, \"Man, I am not.\" [59] And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying, \"Certainly this man also was with him, for he too is a Galilean.\" [60] But Peter said, \"Man, I do not know what you are talking about.\" And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed. [61] And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him, \"Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.\" [62] And he went out and wept bitterly.\n\n[63] Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking him as they beat him. [64] They also blindfolded him and kept asking him, \"Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?\" [65] And they said many other things against him, blaspheming him.\n\n[66] When day came, the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes. And they led him away to their council, and they said, [67] \"If you are the Christ, tell us.\" But he said to them, \"If I tell you, you will not believe, [68] and if I ask you, you will not answer. [69] But from now on the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God.\" [70] So they all said, \"Are you the Son of God, then?\" And he said to them, \"You say that I am.\" [71] Then they said, \"What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips.\""
    ,"[1] Then the whole company of them arose and brought him before Pilate. [2] And they began to accuse him, saying, \"We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.\" [3] And Pilate asked him, \"Are you the King of the Jews?\" And he answered him, \"You have said so.\" [4] Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, \"I find no guilt in this man.\" [5] But they were urgent, saying, \"He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place.\"\n\n[6] When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. [7] And when he learned that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time. [8] When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign done by him. [9] So he questioned him at some length, but he made no answer. [10] The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him. [11] And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him. Then, arraying him in splendid clothing, he sent him back to Pilate. [12] And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.\n\n[13] Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, [14] and said to them, \"You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people. And after examining him before you, behold, I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him. [15] Neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Look, nothing deserving death has been done by him. [16] I will therefore punish and release him.\"\n\n[18] But they all cried out together, \"Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas\"â[19] a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city and for murder. [20] Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus, [21] but they kept shouting, \"Crucify, crucify him!\" [22] A third time he said to them, \"Why? What evil has he done? I have found in him no guilt deserving death. I will therefore punish and release him.\" [23] But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified. And their voices prevailed. [24] So Pilate decided that their demand should be granted. [25] He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus over to their will.\n\n[26] And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus. [27] And there followed him a great multitude of the people and of women who were mourning and lamenting for him. [28] But turning to them Jesus said, \"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. [29] For behold, the days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!' [30] Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us,' and to the hills, 'Cover us.' [31] For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?\"\n\n[32] Two others, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him. [33] And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. [34] And Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\" And they cast lots to divide his garments. [35] And the people stood by, watching, but the rulers scoffed at him, saying, \"He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One!\" [36] The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine [37] and saying, \"If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!\" [38] There was also an inscription over him, \"This is the King of the Jews.\"\n\n[39] One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, \"Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!\" [40] But the other rebuked him, saying, \"Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? [41] And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.\" [42] And he said, \"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\" [43] And he said to him, \"Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.\"\n\n[44] It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour, [45] while the sun's light failed. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. [46] Then Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, \"Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!\" And having said this he breathed his last. [47] Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God, saying, \"Certainly this man was innocent!\" [48] And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts. [49] And all his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance watching these things.\n\n[50] Now there was a man named Joseph, from the Jewish town of Arimathea. He was a member of the council, a good and righteous man, [51] who had not consented to their decision and action; and he was looking for the kingdom of God. [52] This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. [53] Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud and laid him in a tomb cut in stone, where no one had ever yet been laid. [54] It was the day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was beginning. [55] The women who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was laid. [56] Then they returned and prepared spices and ointments.\n\nOn the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment."
    ,"[1] But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared. [2] And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, [3] but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. [4] While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel. [5] And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, \"Why do you seek the living among the dead? [6] He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, [7] that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.\" [8] And they remembered his words, [9] and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. [10] Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles, [11] but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. [12] But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened.\n\n[13] That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, [14] and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened. [15] While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. [16] But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. [17] And he said to them, \"What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?\" And they stood still, looking sad. [18] Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, \"Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?\" [19] And he said to them, \"What things?\" And they said to him, \"Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, [20] and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. [21] But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. [22] Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, [23] and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. [24] Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.\" [25] And he said to them, \"O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! [26] Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?\" [27] And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.\n\n[28] So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther, [29] but they urged him strongly, saying, \"Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.\" So he went in to stay with them. [30] When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them. [31] And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight. [32] They said to each other, \"Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?\" [33] And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, [34] saying, \"The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!\" [35] Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.\n\n[36] As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, \"Peace to you!\" [37] But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit. [38] And he said to them, \"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? [39] See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.\" [40] And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. [41] And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling, he said to them, \"Have you anything here to eat?\" [42] They gave him a piece of broiled fish, [43] and he took it and ate before them.\n\n[44] Then he said to them, \"These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.\" [45] Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, [46] and said to them, \"Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, [47] and that repentance for the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. [48] You are witnesses of these things. [49] And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.\"\n\n[50] And he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them. [51] While he blessed them, he parted from them and was carried up into heaven. [52] And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, [53] and were continually in the temple blessing God."
