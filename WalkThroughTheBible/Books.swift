    ["[1] The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.\n\n[2] Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers, [3] and Judah the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram, [4] and Ram the father of Amminadab, and Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon, [5] and Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse, [6] and Jesse the father of David the king.\n\nAnd David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah, [7] and Solomon the father of Rehoboam, and Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asaph, [8] and Asaph the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah, [9] and Uzziah the father of Jotham, and Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah, [10] and Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh the father of Amos, and Amos the father of Josiah, [11] and Josiah the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon. [12] And after the deportation to Babylon: Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel, [13] and Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, and Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor, [14] and Azor the father of Zadok, and Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud, [15] and Eliud the father of Eleazar, and Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob, [16] and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.\n\n[17] So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.\n\n[18] Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. [19] And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. [20] But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, \"Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. [21] She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.\" [22] All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:\n\n[23] \"Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel\" (which means, God with us).\n\n[24] When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, [25] but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus."
    ,"[1] Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem [2] saying, \"Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.\" [3] When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; [4] and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. [5] They told him, \"In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:\n\n[6] \"'And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'\"\n\n[7] Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared. [8] And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, \"Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.\" [9] After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was. [10] When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. [11] And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. [12] And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.\n\n[13] Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, \"Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.\" [14] And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt [15] and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, \"Out of Egypt I called my son.\" [16] Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men. [17] Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:\n\n[18] \"A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be comforted, because they are no more.\"\n\n[19] But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, [20] saying, \"Rise, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead.\"[21] And he rose and took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel. [22] But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee. [23] And he went and lived in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, that he would be called a Nazarene."
    ,"[1] In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, [2] \"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\" [3] For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said,\n\n\"The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.'\"\n\n[4] Now John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. [5] Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him, [6] and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.\n\n[7] But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, \"You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? [8] Bear fruit in keeping with repentance. [9] And do not presume to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father,' for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham. [10] Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.\n\n[11] \"I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. [12] His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.\"\n\n[13] Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. [14] John would have prevented him, saying, \"I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?\" [15] But Jesus answered him, \"Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.\" Then he consented. [16] And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him; [17] and behold, a voice from heaven said, \"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.\""
    ,"[1] Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. [2] And after fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. [3] And the tempter came and said to him, \"If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.\" [4] But he answered, \"It is written,\n\n\"'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'\"\n\n[5] Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple [6] and said to him, \"If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written,\n\n\"'He will command his angels concerning you,'\n\nand\n\n\"'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'\"\n\n[7] Jesus said to him, \"Again it is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'\" [8] Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. [9] And he said to him, \"All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.\" [10] Then Jesus said to him, \"Be gone, Satan! For it is written,\n\n\"'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'\"\n\n[11] Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and were ministering to him.\n\n[12] Now when he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee. [13] And leaving Nazareth he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali, [14] so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:\n\n[15] \"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentilesâ[16] the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light, and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death, on them a light has dawned.\"\n\n[17] From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, \"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"\n\n[18] While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. [19] And he said to them, \"Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.\" [20] Immediately they left their nets and followed him. [21] And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them. [22] Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.\n\n[23] And he went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction among the people. [24] So his fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought him all the sick, those afflicted with various diseases and pains, those oppressed by demons, those having seizures, and paralytics, and he healed them. [25] And great crowds followed him from Galilee and the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan."
    ,"[1] Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him. [2] And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:\n\n[3] \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n[4] \"Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.\n[5] \"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.\n[6] \"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.\n[7] \"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.\n[8] \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\n[9] \"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.\n[10] \"Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n[11] \"Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. [12] Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.\n\n[13] \"You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet.\n\n[14] \"You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. [15] Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. [16] In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.\n\n[17] \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. [18] For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. [19] Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. [20] For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.\n\n[21] \"You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.' [22] But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, 'You fool!' will be liable to the hell of fire. [23] So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, [24] leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. [25] Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison. [26] Truly, I say to you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.\n\n[27] \"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' [28] But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. [29] If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. [30] And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.\n\n[31] \"It was also said, 'Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.' [32] But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.\n\n[33] \"Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.' [34] But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, [35] or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. [36] And do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. [37] Let what you say be simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything more than this comes from evil.\n\n[38] \"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' [39] But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. [40] And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. [41] And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. [42] Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.\n\n[43] \"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' [44] But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, [45] so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. [46] For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? [47] And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? [48] You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
    ,"[1] \"Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.\n\n[2] \"Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. [3] But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, [4] so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.\n\n[5] \"And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. [6] But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.\n\n[7] \"And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. [8] Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. [9] Pray then like this:\n\n\"Our Father in heaven,\nhallowed be your name.\n[10] Your kingdom come,\nyour will be done,\non earth as it is in heaven.\n[11] Give us this day our daily bread,\n[12] and forgive us our debts,\nas we also have forgiven our debtors.\n[13] And lead us not into temptation,\nbut deliver us from evil.\n\n[14] For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, [15] but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\n\n[16] \"And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. [17] But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, [18] that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.\n\n[19] \"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, [20] but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. [21] For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\n\n[22] \"The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light, [23] but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!\n\n[24] \"No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.\n\n[25] \"Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? [26] Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? [27] And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? [28] And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, [29] yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. [30] But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? [31] Therefore do not be anxious, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' [32] For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. [33] But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.\n\n[34] \"Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.\""
    ,"[1] \"Judge not, that you be not judged. [2] For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. [3] Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? [4] Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when there is the log in your own eye? [5] You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.\n\n[6] \"Do not give dogs what is holy, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you.\n\n[7] \"Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. [8] For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. [9] Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? [10] Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? [11] If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!\n\n[12] \"So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.\n\n[13] \"Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. [14] For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few.\n\n[15] \"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. [16] You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? [17] So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. [18] A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit. [19] Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. [20] Thus you will recognize them by their fruits.\n\n[21] \"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. [22] On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' [23] And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'\n\n[24] \"Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. [25] And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. [26] And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. [27] And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.\"\n\n[28] And when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching, [29] for he was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes."
    ,"[1] When he came down from the mountain, great crowds followed him. [2] And behold, a leper came to him and knelt before him, saying, \"Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.\" [3] And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, \"I will; be clean.\" And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. [4] And Jesus said to him, \"See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof to them.\"\n\n[5] When he had entered Capernaum, a centurion came forward to him, appealing to him, [6] \"Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, suffering terribly.\" [7] And he said to him, \"I will come and heal him.\" [8] But the centurion replied, \"Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed. [9] For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.\" [10] When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, \"Truly, I tell you, with no one in Israel have I found such faith. [11] I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, [12] while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\" [13] And to the centurion Jesus said, \"Go; let it be done for you as you have believed.\" And the servant was healed at that very moment.\n\n[14] And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever. [15] He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and began to serve him. [16] That evening they brought to him many who were oppressed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick. [17] This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: \"He took our illnesses and bore our diseases.\"\n\n[18] Now when Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave orders to go over to the other side. [19] And a scribe came up and said to him, \"Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.\" [20] And Jesus said to him, \"Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\" [21] Another of the disciples said to him, \"Lord, let me first go and bury my father.\" [22] And Jesus said to him, \"Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.\"\n\n[23] And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him. [24] And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but he was asleep. [25] And they went and woke him, saying, \"Save us, Lord; we are perishing.\" [26] And he said to them, \"Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?\" Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. [27] And the men marveled, saying, \"What sort of man is this, that even winds and sea obey him?\"\n\n[28] And when he came to the other side to the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met him, coming out of the tombs, so fierce that no one could pass that way. [29] And behold, they cried out, \"What have you to do with us, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?\" [30] Now a herd of many pigs was feeding at some distance from them. [31] And the demons begged him, saying, \"If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of pigs.\" [32] And he said to them, \"Go.\" So they came out and went into the pigs, and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the waters. [33] The herdsmen fled, and going into the city they told everything, especially what had happened to the demon-possessed men. [34] And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region."
    ,"[1] And getting into a boat he crossed over and came to his own city. [2] And behold, some people brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, \"Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven.\" [3] And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, \"This man is blaspheming.\" [4] But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, \"Why do you think evil in your hearts? [5] For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'? [6] But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\"âhe then said to the paralyticâ\"Rise, pick up your bed and go home.\" [7] And he rose and went home. [8] When the crowds saw it, they were afraid, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men.\n\n[9] As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, \"Follow me.\" And he rose and followed him.\n\n[10] And as Jesus reclined at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and his disciples. [11] And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, \"Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?\" [12] But when he heard it, he said, \"Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. [13] Go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.' For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.\"\n\n[14] Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, \"Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?\" [15] And Jesus said to them, \"Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast. [16] No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch tears away from the garment, and a worse tear is made. [17] Neither is new wine put into old wineskins. If it is, the skins burst and the wine is spilled and the skins are destroyed. But new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved.\"\n\n[18] While he was saying these things to them, behold, a ruler came in and knelt before him, saying, \"My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.\" [19] And Jesus rose and followed him, with his disciples. [20] And behold, a woman who had suffered from a discharge of blood for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment, [21] for she said to herself, \"If I only touch his garment, I will be made well.\" [22] Jesus turned, and seeing her he said, \"Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well.\" And instantly the woman was made well. [23] And when Jesus came to the ruler's house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion, [24] he said, \"Go away, for the girl is not dead but sleeping.\" And they laughed at him. [25] But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose. [26] And the report of this went through all that district.\n\n[27] And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, \"Have mercy on us, Son of David.\" [28] When he entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, \"Do you believe that I am able to do this?\" They said to him, \"Yes, Lord.\" [29] Then he touched their eyes, saying, \"According to your faith be it done to you.\" [30] And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, \"See that no one knows about it.\" [31] But they went away and spread his fame through all that district.\n\n[32] As they were going away, behold, a demon-oppressed man who was mute was brought to him. [33] And when the demon had been cast out, the mute man spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, \"Never was anything like this seen in Israel.\" [34] But the Pharisees said, \"He casts out demons by the prince of demons.\"\n\n[35] And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction. [36] When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. [37] Then he said to his disciples, \"The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; [38] therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.\""
    ,"[1] And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction. [2] The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; [3] Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; [4] Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.\n\n[5] These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them, \"Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans, [6] but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. [7] And proclaim as you go, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' [8] Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You received without paying; give without pay. [9] Acquire no gold or silver or copper for your belts, [10] no bag for your journey, or two tunics or sandals or a staff, for the laborer deserves his food. [11] And whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy in it and stay there until you depart. [12] As you enter the house, greet it. [13] And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. [14] And if anyone will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town. [15] Truly, I say to you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.\n\n[16] \"Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. [17] Beware of men, for they will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues, [18] and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles. [19] When they deliver you over, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say, for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour. [20] For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. [21] Brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death, [22] and you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. [23] When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next, for truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.\n\n[24] \"A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. [25] It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his household.\n\n[26] \"So have no fear of them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. [27] What I tell you in the dark, say in the light, and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops. [28] And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. [29] Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. [30] But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. [31] Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. [32] So everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven, [33] but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.\n\n[34] \"Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. [35] For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. [36] And a person's enemies will be those of his own household. [37] Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. [38] And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. [39] Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.\n\n[40] \"Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. [41] The one who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and the one who receives a righteous person because he is a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward. [42] And whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward.\""
    ,"[1] When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.\n\n[2] Now when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent word by his disciples [3] and said to him, \"Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?\" [4] And Jesus answered them, \"Go and tell John what you hear and see: [5] the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. [6] And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.\"\n\n[7] As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? [8] What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. [9] What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. [10] This is he of whom it is written,\n\n\"'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'\n\n[11] Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. [12] From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force. [13] For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John, [14] and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. [15] He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\n\n[16] \"But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their playmates,\n\n[17] \"'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'\n\n[18] For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' [19] The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds.\"\n\n[20] Then he began to denounce the cities where most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent. [21] \"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. [22] But I tell you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you. [23] And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. [24] But I tell you that it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you.\"\n\n[25] At that time Jesus declared, \"I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children; [26] yes, Father, for such was your gracious will. [27] All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. [28] Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. [29] Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. [30] For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\""
    ,"[1] At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat. [2] But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, \"Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.\" [3] He said to them, \"Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him: [4] how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests? [5] Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless? [6] I tell you, something greater than the temple is here. [7] And if you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the guiltless. [8] For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.\"\n\n[9] He went on from there and entered their synagogue. [10] And a man was there with a withered hand. And they asked him, \"Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?\"âso that they might accuse him. [11] He said to them, \"Which one of you who has a sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out? [12] Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.\" [13] Then he said to the man, \"Stretch out your hand.\" And the man stretched it out, and it was restored, healthy like the other. [14] But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him, how to destroy him.\n\n[15] Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. And many followed him, and he healed them all [16] and ordered them not to make him known. [17] This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:\n\n[18] \"Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles. [19] He will not quarrel or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets; [20] a bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not quench, until he brings justice to victory; [21] and in his name the Gentiles will hope.\"\n\n[22] Then a demon-oppressed man who was blind and mute was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the man spoke and saw. [23] And all the people were amazed, and said, \"Can this be the Son of David?\" [24] But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, \"It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons.\" [25] Knowing their thoughts, he said to them, \"Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand. [26] And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? [27] And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. [28] But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. [29] Or how can someone enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house. [30] Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. [31] Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. [32] And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.\n\n[33] \"Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for the tree is known by its fruit. [34] You brood of vipers! How can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. [35] The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil. [36] I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, [37] for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.\"\n\n[38] Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, \"Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.\" [39] But he answered them, \"An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. [40] For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. [41] The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here. [42] The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.\n\n[43] \"When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, but finds none. [44] Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' And when it comes, it finds the house empty, swept, and put in order. [45] Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there, and the last state of that person is worse than the first. So also will it be with this evil generation.\"\n\n[46] While he was still speaking to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, asking to speak to him. [48] But he replied to the man who told him, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?\" [49] And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, \"Here are my mother and my brothers! [50] For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.\""
    ,"[1] That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea. [2] And great crowds gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the whole crowd stood on the beach. [3] And he told them many things in parables, saying: \"A sower went out to sow. [4] And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them. [5] Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil, [6] but when the sun rose they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away. [7] Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. [8] Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. [9] He who has ears, let him hear.\"\n\n[10] Then the disciples came and said to him, \"Why do you speak to them in parables?\" [11] And he answered them, \"To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. [12] For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. [13] This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. [14] Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says:\n\n\"'\"You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive.\" [15] For this people's heart has grown dull, and with their ears they can barely hear, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.'\n\n[16] But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. [17] For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.\n\n[18] \"Hear then the parable of the sower: [19] When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path. [20] As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, [21] yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away. [22] As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. [23] As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.\"\n\n[24] He put another parable before them, saying, \"The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field, [25] but while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away. [26] So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also. [27] And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, 'Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?' [28] He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' So the servants said to him, 'Then do you want us to go and gather them?' [29] But he said, 'No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them. [30] Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, \"Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.\"'\"\n\n[31] He put another parable before them, saying, \"The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field. [32] It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.\"\n\n[33] He told them another parable. \"The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till it was all leavened.\"\n\n[34] All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed, he said nothing to them without a parable. [35] This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet:\n\n\"I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world.\"\n\n[36] Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, \"Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.\" [37] He answered, \"The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man. [38] The field is the world, and the good seed is the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one, [39] and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. [40] Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of the age. [41] The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, [42] and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. [43] Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.\n\n[44] \"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.\n\n[45] \"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, [46] who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.\n\n[47] \"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind. [48] When it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad. [49] So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous [50] and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n\n[51] \"Have you understood all these things?\" They said to him, \"Yes.\" [52] And he said to them, \"Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.\"\n\n[53] And when Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there, [54] and coming to his hometown he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, \"Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works? [55] Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? [56] And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?\" [57] And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, \"A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household.\" [58] And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief."
    ,"[1] At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus, [2] and he said to his servants, \"This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.\" [3] For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, [4] because John had been saying to him, \"It is not lawful for you to have her.\" [5] And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet. [6] But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod, [7] so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. [8] Prompted by her mother, she said, \"Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.\" [9] And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given. [10] He sent and had John beheaded in the prison, [11] and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. [12] And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus.\n\n[13] Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns. [14] When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick. [15] Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, \"This is a desolate place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves.\" [16] But Jesus said, \"They need not go away; you give them something to eat.\" [17] They said to him, \"We have only five loaves here and two fish.\" [18] And he said, \"Bring them here to me.\" [19] Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. [20] And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over. [21] And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.\n\n[22] Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds. [23] And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone, [24] but the boat by this time was a long way from the land, beaten by the waves, for the wind was against them. [25] And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. [26] But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, \"It is a ghost!\" and they cried out in fear. [27] But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, \"Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.\"\n\n[28] And Peter answered him, \"Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.\" [29] He said, \"Come.\" So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus. [30] But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, \"Lord, save me.\" [31] Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, \"O you of little faith, why did you doubt?\" [32] And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased. [33] And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, \"Truly you are the Son of God.\"\n\n[34] And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret. [35] And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent around to all that region and brought to him all who were sick [36] and implored him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well."
    ,"[1] Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said, [2] \"Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat.\" [3] He answered them, \"And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? [4] For God commanded, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.' [5] But you say, 'If anyone tells his father or his mother, \"What you would have gained from me is given to God,\" [6] he need not honor his father.' So for the sake of your tradition you have made void the word of God. [7] You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said:\n\n[8] \"'This people honors me with their lips,\nbut their heart is far from me;\n[9] in vain do they worship me,\nteaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'\"\n\n[10] And he called the people to him and said to them, \"Hear and understand: [11] it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person.\" [12] Then the disciples came and said to him, \"Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?\" [13] He answered, \"Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up. [14] Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.\" [15] But Peter said to him, \"Explain the parable to us.\" [16] And he said, \"Are you also still without understanding? [17] Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled? [18] But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person. [19] For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander. [20] These are what defile a person. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile anyone.\"\n\n[21] And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon. [22] And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and was crying, \"Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon.\" [23] But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying, \"Send her away, for she is crying out after us.\" [24] He answered, \"I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\" [25] But she came and knelt before him, saying, \"Lord, help me.\" [26] And he answered, \"It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.\" [27] She said, \"Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.\" [28] Then Jesus answered her, \"O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire.\" And her daughter was healed instantly.\n\n[29] Jesus went on from there and walked beside the Sea of Galilee. And he went up on the mountain and sat down there. [30] And great crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and they put them at his feet, and he healed them, [31] so that the crowd wondered, when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.\n\n[32] Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, \"I have compassion on the crowd because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat. And I am unwilling to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.\" [33] And the disciples said to him, \"Where are we to get enough bread in such a desolate place to feed so great a crowd?\" [34] And Jesus said to them, \"How many loaves do you have?\" They said, \"Seven, and a few small fish.\" [35] And directing the crowd to sit down on the ground, [36] he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. [37] And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over. [38] Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. [39] And after sending away the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan."
    ,"[1] And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and to test him they asked him to show them a sign from heaven. [2] He answered them, \"When it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.' [3] And in the morning, 'It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and threatening.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. [4] An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.\" So he left them and departed.\n\n[5] When the disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to bring any bread. [6] Jesus said to them, \"Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\" [7] And they began discussing it among themselves, saying, \"We brought no bread.\" [8] But Jesus, aware of this, said, \"O you of little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have no bread? [9] Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered? [10] Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered? [11] How is it that you fail to understand that I did not speak about bread? Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\" [12] Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\n\n[13] Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, \"Who do people say that the Son of Man is?\" [14] And they said, \"Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.\" [15] He said to them, \"But who do you say that I am?\" [16] Simon Peter replied, \"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" [17] And Jesus answered him, \"Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. [18] And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. [19] I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\" [20] Then he strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.\n\n[21] From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised. [22] And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, \"Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you.\" [23] But he turned and said to Peter, \"Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.\"\n\n[24] Then Jesus told his disciples, \"If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. [25] For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. [26] For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul? [27] For the Son of Man is going to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay each person according to what he has done. [28] Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\""
    ,"[1] And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. [2] And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light. [3] And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him. [4] And Peter said to Jesus, \"Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.\" [5] He was still speaking when, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, \"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.\" [6] When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified. [7] But Jesus came and touched them, saying, \"Rise, and have no fear.\" [8] And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.\n\n[9] And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, \"Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.\" [10] And the disciples asked him, \"Then why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?\" [11] He answered, \"Elijah does come, and he will restore all things. [12] But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of Man will certainly suffer at their hands.\" [13] Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.\n\n[14] And when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and, kneeling before him, [15] said, \"Lord, have mercy on my son, for he has seizures and he suffers terribly. For often he falls into the fire, and often into the water. [16] And I brought him to your disciples, and they could not heal him.\" [17] And Jesus answered, \"O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to me.\" [18] And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was healed instantly. [19] Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, \"Why could we not cast it out?\" [20] He said to them, \"Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.\"\n\n[22] As they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said to them, \"The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men, [23] and they will kill him, and he will be raised on the third day.\" And they were greatly distressed.\n\n[24] When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma tax went up to Peter and said, \"Does your teacher not pay the tax?\" [25] He said, \"Yes.\" And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, \"What do you think, Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tax? From their sons or from others?\" [26] And when he said, \"From others,\" Jesus said to him, \"Then the sons are free. [27] However, not to give offense to them, go to the sea and cast a hook and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel. Take that and give it to them for me and for yourself.\""
    ,"[1] At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, \"Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\" [2] And calling to him a child, he put him in the midst of them [3] and said, \"Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. [4] Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.\n\n[5] \"Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, [6] but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.\n\n[7] \"Woe to the world for temptations to sin! For it is necessary that temptations come, but woe to the one by whom the temptation comes! [8] And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire. [9] And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire.\n\n[10] \"See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven. [12] What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray? [13] And if he finds it, truly, I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray. [14] So it is not the will of my Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.\n\n[15] \"If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. [16] But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. [17] If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. [18] Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. [19] Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. [20] For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.\"\n\n[21] Then Peter came up and said to him, \"Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?\" [22] Jesus said to him, \"I do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times.\n\n[23] \"Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants. [24] When he began to settle, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. [25] And since he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made. [26] So the servant fell on his knees, imploring him, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.' [27] And out of pity for him, the master of that servant released him and forgave him the debt. [28] But when that same servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii, and seizing him, he began to choke him, saying, 'Pay what you owe.' [29] So his fellow servant fell down and pleaded with him, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you.' [30] He refused and went and put him in prison until he should pay the debt. [31] When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their master all that had taken place. [32] Then his master summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. [33] And should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?' [34] And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers, until he should pay all his debt. [35] So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.\""
    ,"[1] Now when Jesus had finished these sayings, he went away from Galilee and entered the region of Judea beyond the Jordan. [2] And large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.\n\n[3] And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, \"Is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause?\" [4] He answered, \"Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, [5] and said, 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'? [6] So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.\" [7] They said to him, \"Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?\" [8] He said to them, \"Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. [9] And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.\"\n\n[10] The disciples said to him, \"If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.\" [11] But he said to them, \"Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given. [12] For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it.\"\n\n[13] Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked the people, [14] but Jesus said, \"Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.\" [15] And he laid his hands on them and went away.\n\n[16] And behold, a man came up to him, saying, \"Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?\" [17] And he said to him, \"Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments.\" [18] He said to him, \"Which ones?\" And Jesus said, \"You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, [19] Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\" [20] The young man said to him, \"All these I have kept. What do I still lack?\" [21] Jesus said to him, \"If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.\" [22] When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.\n\n[23] And Jesus said to his disciples, \"Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. [24] Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.\" [25] When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, \"Who then can be saved?\" [26] But Jesus looked at them and said, \"With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.\" [27] Then Peter said in reply, \"See, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?\" [28] Jesus said to them, \"Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. [29] And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life. [30] But many who are first will be last, and the last first."
    ,"[1] \"For the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. [2] After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. [3] And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the marketplace, [4] and to them he said, 'You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.' [5] So they went. Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same. [6] And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing. And he said to them, 'Why do you stand here idle all day?' [7] They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too.' [8] And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.' [9] And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius. [10] Now when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more, but each of them also received a denarius. [11] And on receiving it they grumbled at the master of the house, [12] saying, 'These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.' [13] But he replied to one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? [14] Take what belongs to you and go. I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you. [15] Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or do you begrudge my generosity?' [16] So the last will be first, and the first last.\"\n\n[17] And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them, [18] \"See, we are going up to Jerusalem. And the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death [19] and deliver him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified, and he will be raised on the third day.\"\n\n[20] Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came up to him with her sons, and kneeling before him she asked him for something. [21] And he said to her, \"What do you want?\" She said to him, \"Say that these two sons of mine are to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.\" [22] Jesus answered, \"You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am to drink?\" They said to him, \"We are able.\" [23] He said to them, \"You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.\" [24] And when the ten heard it, they were indignant at the two brothers. [25] But Jesus called them to him and said, \"You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. [26] It shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, [27] and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, [28] even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\"\n\n[29] And as they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him. [30] And behold, there were two blind men sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, \"Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!\" [31] The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be silent, but they cried out all the more, \"Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!\" [32] And stopping, Jesus called them and said, \"What do you want me to do for you?\" [33] They said to him, \"Lord, let our eyes be opened.\" [34] And Jesus in pity touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight and followed him."
    ,"[1] Now when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, [2] saying to them, \"Go into the village in front of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me. [3] If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord needs them,' and he will send them at once.\" [4] This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying,\n\n[5] \"Say to the daughter of Zion,\n'Behold, your king is coming to you,\nhumble, and mounted on a donkey,\non a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.'\"\n\n[6] The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them. [7] They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks, and he sat on them. [8] Most of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. [9] And the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting, \"Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!\" [10] And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, \"Who is this?\" [11] And the crowds said, \"This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.\"\n\n[12] And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. [13] He said to them, \"It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you make it a den of robbers.\"\n\n[14] And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them. [15] But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple, \"Hosanna to the Son of David!\" they were indignant, [16] and they said to him, \"Do you hear what these are saying?\" And Jesus said to them, \"Yes; have you never read,\n\n\"'Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies\nyou have prepared praise'?\"\n\n[17] And leaving them, he went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there.\n\n[18] In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he became hungry. [19] And seeing a fig tree by the wayside, he went to it and found nothing on it but only leaves. And he said to it, \"May no fruit ever come from you again!\" And the fig tree withered at once.\n\n[20] When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, \"How did the fig tree wither at once?\" [21] And Jesus answered them, \"Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen. [22] And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.\"\n\n[23] And when he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, \"By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?\" [24] Jesus answered them, \"I also will ask you one question, and if you tell me the answer, then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things. [25] The baptism of John, from where did it come? From heaven or from man?\" And they discussed it among themselves, saying, \"If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?' [26] But if we say, 'From man,' we are afraid of the crowd, for they all hold that John was a prophet.\" [27] So they answered Jesus, \"We do not know.\" And he said to them, \"Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\n\n[28] \"What do you think? A man had two sons. And he went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work in the vineyard today.' [29] And he answered, 'I will not,' but afterward he changed his mind and went. [30] And he went to the other son and said the same. And he answered, 'I go, sir,' but did not go. [31] Which of the two did the will of his father?\" They said, \"The first.\" Jesus said to them, \"Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you. [32] For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him.\n\n[33] \"Hear another parable. There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and leased it to tenants, and went into another country. [34] When the season for fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to get his fruit. [35] And the tenants took his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another. [36] Again he sent other servants, more than the first. And they did the same to them. [37] Finally he sent his son to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' [38] But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and have his inheritance.' [39] And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. [40] When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?\" [41] They said to him, \"He will put those wretches to a miserable death and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons.\"\n\n[42] Jesus said to them, \"Have you never read in the Scriptures:\n\n\"'The stone that the builders rejected\nhas become the cornerstone;\nthis was the Lord's doing,\nand it is marvelous in our eyes'?\n\n[43] Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits. [44] And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.\"\n\n[45] When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he was speaking about them. [46] And although they were seeking to arrest him, they feared the crowds, because they held him to be a prophet."
    ,"[1] And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying, [2] \"The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son, [3] and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come. [4] Again he sent other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, \"See, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.\"' [5] But they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business, [6] while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. [7] The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. [8] Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy. [9] Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.' [10] And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests.\n\n[11] \"But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment. [12] And he said to him, 'Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?' And he was speechless. [13] Then the king said to the attendants, 'Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' [14] For many are called, but few are chosen.\"\n\n[15] Then the Pharisees went and plotted how to entangle him in his words. [16] And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, \"Teacher, we know that you are true and teach the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone's opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances. [17] Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?\" [18] But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, \"Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? [19] Show me the coin for the tax.\" And they brought him a denarius. [20] And Jesus said to them, \"Whose likeness and inscription is this?\" [21] They said, \"Caesar's.\" Then he said to them, \"Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\" [22] When they heard it, they marveled. And they left him and went away.\n\n[23] The same day Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him a question, [24] saying, \"Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies having no children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.' [25] Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died, and having no offspring left his wife to his brother. [26] So too the second and third, down to the seventh. [27] After them all, the woman died. [28] In the resurrection, therefore, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her.\"\n\n[29] But Jesus answered them, \"You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God. [30] For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. [31] And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God: [32] 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not God of the dead, but of the living.\" [33] And when the crowd heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.\n\n[34] But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. [35] And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. [36] \"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?\" [37] And he said to him, \"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. [38] This is the great and first commandment. [39] And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. [40] On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.\"\n\n[41] Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, [42] saying, \"What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?\" They said to him, \"The son of David.\" [43] He said to them, \"How is it then that David, in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying,\n\n[44] \"'The Lord said to my Lord,\n\"Sit at my right hand,\nuntil I put your enemies under your feet\"'?\n\n[45] If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?\" [46] And no one was able to answer him a word, nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions."
    ,"[1] Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, [2] \"The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat, [3] so do and observe whatever they tell you, but not the works they do. For they preach, but do not practice. [4] They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on people's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger. [5] They do all their deeds to be seen by others. For they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long, [6] and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues [7] and greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi by others. [8] But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers. [9] And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. [10] Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ. [11] The greatest among you shall be your servant. [12] Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.\n\n[13] \"But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. For you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in. [15] Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel across sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.\n\n[16] \"Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.' [17] You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred? [18] And you say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gift that is on the altar, he is bound by his oath.' [19] You blind men! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred? [20] So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it. [21] And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and by him who dwells in it. [22] And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it.\n\n[23] \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others. [24] You blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel!\n\n[25] \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. [26] You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, that the outside also may be clean.\n\n[27] \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness. [28] So you also outwardly appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.\n\n[29] \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous, [30] saying, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' [31] Thus you witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. [32] Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers. [33] You serpents, you brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell? [34] Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town, [35] so that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. [36] Truly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.\n\n[37] \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing! [38] See, your house is left to you desolate. [39] For I tell you, you will not see me again, until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'\""
    ,"[1] Jesus left the temple and was going away, when his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple. [2] But he answered them, \"You see all these, do you not? Truly, I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.\"\n\n[3] As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, \"Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?\" [4] And Jesus answered them, \"See that no one leads you astray. [5] For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and they will lead many astray. [6] And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. [7] For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. [8] All these are but the beginning of the birth pains.\n\n[9] \"Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake. [10] And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another. [11] And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. [12] And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. [13] But the one who endures to the end will be saved. [14] And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\n\n[15] \"So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), [16] then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. [17] Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house, [18] and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. [19] And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! [20] Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. [21] For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. [22] And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. [23] Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There he is!' do not believe it. [24] For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. [25] See, I have told you beforehand. [26] So, if they say to you, 'Look, he is in the wilderness,' do not go out. If they say, 'Look, he is in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. [27] For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. [28] Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.\n\n[29] \"Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. [30] Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. [31] And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.\n\n[32] \"From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near. [33] So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very gates. [34] Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. [35] Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.\n\n[36] \"But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. [37] For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. [38] For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, [39] and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. [40] Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left. [41] Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left. [42] Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. [43] But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. [44] Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.\n\n[45] \"Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time? [46] Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes. [47] Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. [48] But if that wicked servant says to himself, 'My master is delayed,' [49] and begins to beat his fellow servants and eats and drinks with drunkards, [50] the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know [51] and will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
    ,"[1] \"Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. [2] Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. [3] For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them, [4] but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. [5] As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept. [6] But at midnight there was a cry, 'Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.' [7] Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. [8] And the foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.' [9] But the wise answered, saying, 'Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.' [10] And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. [11] Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, 'Lord, lord, open to us.' [12] But he answered, 'Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.' [13] Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.\n\n[14] \"For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property. [15] To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. [16] He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. [17] So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. [18] But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. [19] Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. [20] And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me five talents; here, I have made five talents more.' [21] His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.' [22] And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me two talents; here, I have made two talents more.' [23] His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.' [24] He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, [25] so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, you have what is yours.' [26] But his master answered him, 'You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed? [27] Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. [28] So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. [29] For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. [30] And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'\n\n[31] \"When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. [32] Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. [33] And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. [34] Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. [35] For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, [36] I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.' [37] Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? [38] And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? [39] And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?' [40] And the King will answer them, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.'\n\n[41] \"Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. [42] For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, [43] I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.' [44] Then they also will answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?' [45] Then he will answer them, saying, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.' [46] And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.\""
    ,"[1] When Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples, [2] \"You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.\"\n\n[3] Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas, [4] and plotted together in order to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him. [5] But they said, \"Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.\"\n\n[6] Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, [7] a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he reclined at table. [8] And when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, \"Why this waste? [9] For this could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor.\" [10] But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, \"Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me. [11] For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me. [12] In pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it to prepare me for burial. [13] Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.\"\n\n[14] Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests [15] and said, \"What will you give me if I deliver him over to you?\" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver. [16] And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him.\n\n[17] Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, \"Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover?\" [18] He said, \"Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, 'The Teacher says, My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'\" [19] And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.\n\n[20] When it was evening, he reclined at table with the twelve. [21] And as they were eating, he said, \"Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.\" [22] And they were very sorrowful and began to say to him one after another, \"Is it I, Lord?\" [23] He answered, \"He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me. [24] The Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.\" [25] Judas, who would betray him, answered, \"Is it I, Rabbi?\" He said to him, \"You have said so.\"\n\n[26] Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, \"Take, eat; this is my body.\" [27] And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, \"Drink of it, all of you, [28] for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. [29] I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.\"\n\n[30] And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. [31] Then Jesus said to them, \"You will all fall away because of me this night. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' [32] But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.\" [33] Peter answered him, \"Though they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.\" [34] Jesus said to him, \"Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.\" [35] Peter said to him, \"Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you!\" And all the disciples said the same.\n\n[36] Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, \"Sit here, while I go over there and pray.\" [37] And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. [38] Then he said to them, \"My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.\" [39] And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, \"My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.\" [40] And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, \"So, could you not watch with me one hour? [41] Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\" [42] Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, \"My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.\" [43] And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. [44] So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words again. [45] Then he came to the disciples and said to them, \"Sleep and take your rest later on. See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. [46] Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.\"\n\n[47] While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people. [48] Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, \"The one I will kiss is the man; seize him.\" [49] And he came up to Jesus at once and said, \"Greetings, Rabbi!\" And he kissed him. [50] Jesus said to him, \"Friend, do what you came to do.\" Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him. [51] And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. [52] Then Jesus said to him, \"Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword. [53] Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? [54] But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?\" [55] At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, \"Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. [56] But all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.\" Then all the disciples left him and fled.\n\n[57] Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered. [58] And Peter was following him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end. [59] Now the chief priests and the whole council were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death, [60] but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward [61] and said, \"This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in three days.'\" [62] And the high priest stood up and said, \"Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?\" [63] But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, \"I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.\" [64] Jesus said to him, \"You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" [65] Then the high priest tore his robes and said, \"He has uttered blasphemy. What further witnesses do we need? You have now heard his blasphemy. [66] What is your judgment?\" They answered, \"He deserves death.\" [67] Then they spit in his face and struck him. And some slapped him, [68] saying, \"Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?\"\n\n[69] Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came up to him and said, \"You also were with Jesus the Galilean.\" [70] But he denied it before them all, saying, \"I do not know what you mean.\" [71] And when he went out to the entrance, another servant girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders, \"This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.\" [72] And again he denied it with an oath: \"I do not know the man.\" [73] After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, \"Certainly you too are one of them, for your accent betrays you.\" [74] Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, \"I do not know the man.\" And immediately the rooster crowed. [75] And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, \"Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.\" And he went out and wept bitterly."
    ,"[1] When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death. [2] And they bound him and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate the governor.\n\n[3] Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he changed his mind and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, [4] saying, \"I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.\" They said, \"What is that to us? See to it yourself.\" [5] And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself. [6] But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, \"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money.\" [7] So they took counsel and bought with them the potter's field as a burial place for strangers. [8] Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. [9] Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel, [10] and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me.\"\n\n[11] Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, \"Are you the King of the Jews?\" Jesus said, \"You have said so.\" [12] But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer. [13] Then Pilate said to him, \"Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?\" [14] But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.\n\n[15] Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted. [16] And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. [17] So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, \"Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?\" [18] For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up. [19] Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, \"Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today in a dream.\" [20] Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. [21] The governor again said to them, \"Which of the two do you want me to release for you?\" And they said, \"Barabbas.\" [22] Pilate said to them, \"Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?\" They all said, \"Let him be crucified!\" [23] And he said, \"Why? What evil has he done?\" But they shouted all the more, \"Let him be crucified!\"\n\n[24] So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, \"I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves.\" [25] And all the people answered, \"His blood be on us and on our children!\" [26] Then he released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.\n\n[27] Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor's headquarters, and they gathered the whole battalion before him. [28] And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, [29] and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, \"Hail, King of the Jews!\" [30] And they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head. [31] And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and led him away to crucify him.\n\n[32] As they went out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They compelled this man to carry his cross. [33] And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull), [34] they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall, but when he tasted it, he would not drink it. [35] And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots. [36] Then they sat down and kept watch over him there. [37] And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, \"This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.\" [38] Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left. [39] And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads [40] and saying, \"You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.\" [41] So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying, [42] \"He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. [43] He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him. For he said, 'I am the Son of God.'\" [44] And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.\n\n[45] Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. [46] And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, \"Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?\" that is, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" [47] And some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, \"This man is calling Elijah.\" [48] And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink. [49] But the others said, \"Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.\" [50] And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.\n\n[51] And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split. [52] The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, [53] and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many. [54] When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe and said, \"Truly this was the Son of God!\"\n\n[55] There were also many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him, [56] among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.\n\n[57] When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. [58] He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. [59] And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud [60] and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. [61] Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.\n\n[62] The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate [63] and said, \"Sir, we remember how that impostor said, while he was still alive, 'After three days I will rise.' [64] Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last fraud will be worse than the first.\" [65] Pilate said to them, \"You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can.\" [66] So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard."
    ,"[1] Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. [2] And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it. [3] His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. [4] And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men. [5] But the angel said to the women, \"Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. [6] He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay. [7] Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. See, I have told you.\" [8] So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples. [9] And behold, Jesus met them and said, \"Greetings!\" And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him. [10] Then Jesus said to them, \"Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.\"\n\n[11] While they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place. [12] And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers [13] and said, \"Tell people, 'His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.' [14] And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.\" [15] So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.\n\n[16] Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. [17] And when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted. [18] And Jesus came and said to them, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. [19] Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, [20] teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.\""]
    ,"Mark":[
    "[1] The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.\n\n[2] As it is written in Isaiah the prophet,\n\n\"Behold, I send my messenger before your face,\nwho will prepare your way,\n[3] the voice of one crying in the wilderness:\n'Prepare the way of the Lord,\nmake his paths straight,'\"\n\n[4] John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. [5] And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. [6] Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey. [7] And he preached, saying, \"After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. [8] I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.\"\n\n[9] In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. [10] And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. [11] And a voice came from heaven, \"You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.\"\n\n[12] The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. [13] And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.\n\n[14] Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God, [15] and saying, \"The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.\"\n\n[16] Passing alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. [17] And Jesus said to them, \"Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men.\" [18] And immediately they left their nets and followed him. [19] And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets. [20] And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed him.\n\n[21] And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and was teaching. [22] And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. [23] And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out, [24] \"What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you areâthe Holy One of God.\" [25] But Jesus rebuked him, saying, \"Be silent, and come out of him!\" [26] And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, came out of him. [27] And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, \"What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.\" [28] And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.\n\n[29] And immediately he left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. [30] Now Simon's mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. [31] And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.\n\n[32] That evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or oppressed by demons. [33] And the whole city was gathered together at the door. [34] And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. And he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.\n\n[35] And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed. [36] And Simon and those who were with him searched for him, [37] and they found him and said to him, \"Everyone is looking for you.\" [38] And he said to them, \"Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out.\" [39] And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.\n\n[40] And a leper came to him, imploring him, and kneeling said to him, \"If you will, you can make me clean.\" [41] Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, \"I will; be clean.\" [42] And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean. [43] And Jesus sternly charged him and sent him away at once, [44] and said to him, \"See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to them.\" [45] But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in desolate places, and people were coming to him from every quarter."
    ,"[1] And when he returned to Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home. [2] And many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even at the door. And he was preaching the word to them. [3] And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men. [4] And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him, and when they had made an opening, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay. [5] And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, \"Son, your sins are forgiven.\" [6] Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, [7] \"Why does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?\" [8] And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, \"Why do you question these things in your hearts? [9] Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise, take up your bed and walk'? [10] But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\"âhe said to the paralyticâ[11] \"I say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home.\" [12] And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, \"We never saw anything like this!\"\n\n[13] He went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he was teaching them. [14] And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, \"Follow me.\" And he rose and followed him.\n\n[15] And as he reclined at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. [16] And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, \"Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?\" [17] And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, \"Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.\"\n\n[18] Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. And people came and said to him, \"Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?\" [19] And Jesus said to them, \"Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. [20] The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day. [21] No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made. [22] And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skinsâand the wine is destroyed, and so are the skins. But new wine is for fresh wineskins.\"\n\n[23] One Sabbath he was going through the grainfields, and as they made their way, his disciples began to pluck heads of grain. [24] And the Pharisees were saying to him, \"Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?\" [25] And he said to them, \"Have you never read what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he and those who were with him: [26] how he entered the house of God, in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those who were with him?\" [27] And he said to them, \"The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. [28] So the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.\""
    ,"[1] Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there with a withered hand. [2] And they watched Jesus, to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him. [3] And he said to the man with the withered hand, \"Come here.\" [4] And he said to them, \"Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?\" But they were silent. [5] And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, \"Stretch out your hand.\" He stretched it out, and his hand was restored. [6] The Pharisees went out and immediately held counsel with the Herodians against him, how to destroy him.\n\n[7] Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great crowd followed, from Galilee and Judea [8] and Jerusalem and Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon. When the great crowd heard all that he was doing, they came to him. [9] And he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they crush him, [10] for he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed around him to touch him. [11] And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, \"You are the Son of God.\" [12] And he strictly ordered them not to make him known.\n\n[13] And he went up on the mountain and called to him those whom he desired, and they came to him. [14] And he appointed twelve (whom he also named apostles) so that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach [15] and have authority to cast out demons. [16] He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter); [17] James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder); [18] Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot, [19] and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.\n\n[20] Then he went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they could not even eat. [21] And when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, \"He is out of his mind.\"\n\n[22] And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, \"He is possessed by Beelzebul,\" and \"by the prince of demons he casts out the demons.\" [23] And he called them to him and said to them in parables, \"How can Satan cast out Satan? [24] If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. [25] And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. [26] And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end. [27] But no one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. Then indeed he may plunder his house.\n\n[28] \"Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the children of man, and whatever blasphemies they utter, [29] but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin\"â[30] for they were saying, \"He has an unclean spirit.\"\n\n[31] And his mother and his brothers came, and standing outside they sent to him and called him. [32] And a crowd was sitting around him, and they said to him, \"Your mother and your brothers are outside, seeking you.\" [33] And he answered them, \"Who are my mother and my brothers?\" [34] And looking about at those who sat around him, he said, \"Here are my mother and my brothers! [35] For whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother.\""
    ,"[1] Again he began to teach beside the sea. And a very large crowd gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat in it on the sea, and the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land. [2] And he was teaching them many things in parables, and in his teaching he said to them: [3] \"Listen! Behold, a sower went out to sow. [4] And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it. [5] Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth of soil. [6] And when the sun rose, it was scorched, and since it had no root, it withered away. [7] Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain. [8] And other seeds fell into good soil and produced grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.\" [9] And he said, \"He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\"\n\n[10] And when he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables. [11] And he said to them, \"To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables, [12] so that\n\n\"'they may indeed see but not perceive,\nand may indeed hear but not understand,\nlest they should turn and be forgiven.'\"\n\n[13] And he said to them, \"Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables? [14] The sower sows the word. [15] And these are the ones along the path, where the word is sown: when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them. [16] And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: the ones who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy. [17] And they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away. [18] And others are the ones sown among thorns. They are those who hear the word, [19] but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. [20] But those that were sown on the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.\"\n\n[21] And he said to them, \"Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket, or under a bed, and not on a stand? [22] For nothing is hidden except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret except to come to light. [23] If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.\" [24] And he said to them, \"Pay attention to what you hear: with the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and still more will be added to you. [25] For to the one who has, more will be given, and from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.\"\n\n[26] And he said, \"The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground. [27] He sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows; he knows not how. [28] The earth produces by itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. [29] But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.\"\n\n[30] And he said, \"With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it? [31] It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown on the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth, [32] yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and puts out large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.\"\n\n[33] With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it. [34] He did not speak to them without a parable, but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.\n\n[35] On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, \"Let us go across to the other side.\" [36] And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was. And other boats were with him. [37] And a great windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was already filling. [38] But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion. And they woke him and said to him, \"Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?\" [39] And he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, \"Peace! Be still!\" And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. [40] He said to them, \"Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?\" [41] And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, \"Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?\""
    ,"[1] They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes. [2] And when Jesus had stepped out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit. [3] He lived among the tombs. And no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain, [4] for he had often been bound with shackles and chains, but he wrenched the chains apart, and he broke the shackles in pieces. No one had the strength to subdue him. [5] Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones. [6] And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and fell down before him. [7] And crying out with a loud voice, he said, \"What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me.\" [8] For he was saying to him, \"Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!\" [9] And Jesus asked him, \"What is your name?\" He replied, \"My name is Legion, for we are many.\" [10] And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country. [11] Now a great herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, [12] and they begged him, saying, \"Send us to the pigs; let us enter them.\" [13] So he gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the sea.\n\n[14] The herdsmen fled and told it in the city and in the country. And people came to see what it was that had happened. [15] And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man, the one who had had the legion, sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. [16] And those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and to the pigs. [17] And they began to beg Jesus to depart from their region. [18] As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be with him. [19] And he did not permit him but said to him, \"Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.\" [20] And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and everyone marveled.\n\n[21] And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered about him, and he was beside the sea. [22] Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, and seeing him, he fell at his feet [23] and implored him earnestly, saying, \"My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well and live.\" [24] And he went with him.\n\nAnd a great crowd followed him and thronged about him. [25] And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, [26] and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but rather grew worse. [27] She had heard the reports about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment. [28] For she said, \"If I touch even his garments, I will be made well.\" [29] And immediately the flow of blood dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. [30] And Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone out from him, immediately turned about in the crowd and said, \"Who touched my garments?\" [31] And his disciples said to him, \"You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, 'Who touched me?'\" [32] And he looked around to see who had done it. [33] But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him and told him the whole truth. [34] And he said to her, \"Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.\"\n\n[35] While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler's house some who said, \"Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?\" [36] But overhearing what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, \"Do not fear, only believe.\" [37] And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter and James and John the brother of James. [38] They came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and Jesus saw a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly. [39] And when he had entered, he said to them, \"Why are you making a commotion and weeping? The child is not dead but sleeping.\" [40] And they laughed at him. But he put them all outside and took the child's father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was. [41] Taking her by the hand he said to her, \"Talitha cumi,\" which means, \"Little girl, I say to you, arise.\" [42] And immediately the girl got up and began walking (for she was twelve years of age), and they were immediately overcome with amazement. [43] And he strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat."
    ,"[1] He went away from there and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him. [2] And on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished, saying, \"Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to him? How are such mighty works done by his hands? [3] Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?\" And they took offense at him. [4] And Jesus said to them, \"A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household.\" [5] And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them. [6] And he marveled because of their unbelief.\n\nAnd he went about among the villages teaching.\n\n[7] And he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. [8] He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staffâno bread, no bag, no money in their beltsâ[9] but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics. [10] And he said to them, \"Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you depart from there. [11] And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.\" [12] So they went out and proclaimed that people should repent. [13] And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them.\n\n[14] King Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become known. Some said, \"John the Baptist has been raised from the dead. That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.\" [15] But others said, \"He is Elijah.\" And others said, \"He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.\" [16] But when Herod heard of it, he said, \"John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.\" [17] For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because he had married her. [18] For John had been saying to Herod, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\" [19] And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death. But she could not, [20] for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he heard him gladly.\n\n[21] But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. [22] For when Herodias's daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, \"Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.\" [23] And he vowed to her, \"Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.\" [24] And she went out and said to her mother, \"For what should I ask?\" And she said, \"The head of John the Baptist.\" [25] And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, \"I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\" [26] And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. [27] And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. He went and beheaded him in the prison [28] and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. [29] When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.\n\n[30] The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught. [31] And he said to them, \"Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while.\" For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat. [32] And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves. [33] Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. [34] When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things. [35] And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, \"This is a desolate place, and the hour is now late. [36] Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.\" [37] But he answered them, \"You give them something to eat.\" And they said to him, \"Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?\" [38] And he said to them, \"How many loaves do you have? Go and see.\" And when they had found out, they said, \"Five, and two fish.\" [39] Then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass. [40] So they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties. [41] And taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people. And he divided the two fish among them all. [42] And they all ate and were satisfied. [43] And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish. [44] And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.\n\n[45] Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. [46] And after he had taken leave of them, he went up on the mountain to pray. [47] And when evening came, the boat was out on the sea, and he was alone on the land. [48] And he saw that they were making headway painfully, for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. He meant to pass by them, [49] but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out, [50] for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, \"Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.\" [51] And he got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were utterly astounded, [52] for they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.\n\n[53] When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore. [54] And when they got out of the boat, the people immediately recognized him [55] and ran about the whole region and began to bring the sick people on their beds to wherever they heard he was. [56] And wherever he came, in villages, cities, or countryside, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and implored him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well."
    ,"[1] Now when the Pharisees gathered to him, with some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem, [2] they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed. [3] (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands properly, holding to the tradition of the elders, [4] and when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions that they observe, such as the washing of cups and pots and copper vessels and dining couches.) [5] And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, \"Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands?\" [6] And he said to them, \"Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,\n\n\"'This people honors me with their lips,\nbut their heart is far from me;\n[7] in vain do they worship me,\nteaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'\n\n[8] You leave the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men.\"\n\n[9] And he said to them, \"You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to establish your tradition! [10] For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.' [11] But you say, 'If a man tells his father or his mother, \"Whatever you would have gained from me is Corban\"' (that is, given to God)â[12] then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother, [13] thus making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And many such things you do.\"\n\n[14] And he called the people to him again and said to them, \"Hear me, all of you, and understand: [15] There is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him, but the things that come out of a person are what defile him.\" [17] And when he had entered the house and left the people, his disciples asked him about the parable. [18] And he said to them, \"Then are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him, [19] since it enters not his heart but his stomach, and is expelled?\" (Thus he declared all foods clean.) [20] And he said, \"What comes out of a person is what defiles him. [21] For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, [22] coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. [23] All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.\"\n\n[24] And from there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house and did not want anyone to know, yet he could not be hidden. [25] But immediately a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell down at his feet. [26] Now the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter. [27] And he said to her, \"Let the children be fed first, for it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.\" [28] But she answered him, \"Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.\" [29] And he said to her, \"For this statement you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter.\" [30] And she went home and found the child lying in bed and the demon gone.\n\n[31] Then he returned from the region of Tyre and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis. [32] And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had a speech impediment, and they begged him to lay his hand on him. [33] And taking him aside from the crowd privately, he put his fingers into his ears, and after spitting touched his tongue. [34] And looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, \"Ephphatha,\" that is, \"Be opened.\" [35] And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly. [36] And Jesus charged them to tell no one. But the more he charged them, the more zealously they proclaimed it. [37] And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, \"He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.\""
    ,"[1] In those days, when again a great crowd had gathered, and they had nothing to eat, he called his disciples to him and said to them, [2] \"I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat. [3] And if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way. And some of them have come from far away.\" [4] And his disciples answered him, \"How can one feed these people with bread here in this desolate place?\" [5] And he asked them, \"How many loaves do you have?\" They said, \"Seven.\" [6] And he directed the crowd to sit down on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the crowd. [7] And they had a few small fish. And having blessed them, he said that these also should be set before them. [8] And they ate and were satisfied. And they took up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full. [9] And there were about four thousand people. And he sent them away. [10] And immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.\n\n[11] The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him. [12] And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, \"Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.\" [13] And he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side.\n\n[14] Now they had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat. [15] And he cautioned them, saying, \"Watch out; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.\" [16] And they began discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread. [17] And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, \"Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened? [18] Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember? [19] When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?\" They said to him, \"Twelve.\" [20] \"And the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?\" And they said to him, \"Seven.\" [21] And he said to them, \"Do you not yet understand?\"\n\n[22] And they came to Bethsaida. And some people brought to him a blind man and begged him to touch him. [23] And he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village, and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him, he asked him, \"Do you see anything?\" [24] And he looked up and said, \"I see people, but they look like trees, walking.\" [25] Then Jesus laid his hands on his eyes again; and he opened his eyes, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. [26] And he sent him to his home, saying, \"Do not even enter the village.\"\n\n[27] And Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he asked his disciples, \"Who do people say that I am?\" [28] And they told him, \"John the Baptist; and others say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.\" [29] And he asked them, \"But who do you say that I am?\" Peter answered him, \"You are the Christ.\" [30] And he strictly charged them to tell no one about him.\n\n[31] And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again. [32] And he said this plainly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. [33] But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, \"Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.\"\n\n[34] And calling the crowd to him with his disciples, he said to them, \"If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. [35] For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it. [36] For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul? [37] For what can a man give in return for his soul? [38] For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.\""
    ,"[1] And he said to them, \"Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power.\"\n\n[2] And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, [3] and his clothes became radiant, intensely white, as no one on earth could bleach them. [4] And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus. [5] And Peter said to Jesus, \"Rabbi, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.\" [6] For he did not know what to say, for they were terrified. [7] And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, \"This is my beloved Son; listen to him.\" [8] And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only.\n\n[9] And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. [10] So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what this rising from the dead might mean. [11] And they asked him, \"Why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?\" [12] And he said to them, \"Elijah does come first to restore all things. And how is it written of the Son of Man that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt? [13] But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him.\"\n\n[14] And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them. [15] And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him, were greatly amazed and ran up to him and greeted him. [16] And he asked them, \"What are you arguing about with them?\" [17] And someone from the crowd answered him, \"Teacher, I brought my son to you, for he has a spirit that makes him mute. [18] And whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid. So I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able.\" [19] And he answered them, \"O faithless generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me.\" [20] And they brought the boy to him. And when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth. [21] And Jesus asked his father, \"How long has this been happening to him?\" And he said, \"From childhood. [22] And it has often cast him into fire and into water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.\" [23] And Jesus said to him, \"'If you can'! All things are possible for one who believes.\" [24] Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, \"I believe; help my unbelief!\" [25] And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, \"You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.\" [26] And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out, and the boy was like a corpse, so that most of them said, \"He is dead.\" [27] But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose. [28] And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, \"Why could we not cast it out?\" [29] And he said to them, \"This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer.\"\n\n[30] They went on from there and passed through Galilee. And he did not want anyone to know, [31] for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, \"The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he is killed, after three days he will rise.\" [32] But they did not understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.\n\n[33] And they came to Capernaum. And when he was in the house he asked them, \"What were you discussing on the way?\" [34] But they kept silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest. [35] And he sat down and called the twelve. And he said to them, \"If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.\" [36] And he took a child and put him in the midst of them, and taking him in his arms, he said to them, [37] \"Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me.\"\n\n[38] John said to him, \"Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he was not following us.\" [39] But Jesus said, \"Do not stop him, for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me. [40] For the one who is not against us is for us. [41] For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ will by no means lose his reward.\n\n[42] \"Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea. [43] And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell, to the unquenchable fire. [45] And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell. [47] And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell, [48] 'where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.' [49] For everyone will be salted with fire. [50] Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, how will you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.\""
    ,"[1] And he left there and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan, and crowds gathered to him again. And again, as was his custom, he taught them.\n\n[2] And Pharisees came up and in order to test him asked, \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?\" [3] He answered them, \"What did Moses command you?\" [4] They said, \"Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and to send her away.\" [5] And Jesus said to them, \"Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. [6] But from the beginning of creation, 'God made them male and female.' [7] 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, [8] and the two shall become one flesh.' So they are no longer two but one flesh. [9] What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.\"\n\n[10] And in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter. [11] And he said to them, \"Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her, [12] and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.\"\n\n[13] And they were bringing children to him that he might touch them, and the disciples rebuked them. [14] But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, \"Let the children come to me; do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. [15] Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.\" [16] And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands on them.\n\n[17] And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, \"Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" [18] And Jesus said to him, \"Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. [19] You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.'\" [20] And he said to him, \"Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth.\" [21] And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, \"You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.\" [22] Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.\n\n[23] And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, \"How difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!\" [24] And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, \"Children, how difficult it is to enter the kingdom of God! [25] It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.\" [26] And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, \"Then who can be saved?\" [27] Jesus looked at them and said, \"With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.\" [28] Peter began to say to him, \"See, we have left everything and followed you.\" [29] Jesus said, \"Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, [30] who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life. [31] But many who are first will be last, and the last first.\"\n\n[32] And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. And they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was to happen to him, [33] saying, \"See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and deliver him over to the Gentiles. [34] And they will mock him and spit on him, and flog him and kill him. And after three days he will rise.\"\n\n[35] And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, \"Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.\" [36] And he said to them, \"What do you want me to do for you?\" [37] And they said to him, \"Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.\" [38] Jesus said to them, \"You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?\" [39] And they said to him, \"We are able.\" And Jesus said to them, \"The cup that I drink you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized, [40] but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.\" [41] And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant at James and John. [42] And Jesus called them to him and said to them, \"You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. [43] But it shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, [44] and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all. [45] For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\"\n\n[46] And they came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside. [47] And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, \"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!\" [48] And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, \"Son of David, have mercy on me!\" [49] And Jesus stopped and said, \"Call him.\" And they called the blind man, saying to him, \"Take heart. Get up; he is calling you.\" [50] And throwing off his cloak, he sprang up and came to Jesus. [51] And Jesus said to him, \"What do you want me to do for you?\" And the blind man said to him, \"Rabbi, let me recover my sight.\" [52] And Jesus said to him, \"Go your way; your faith has made you well.\" And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him on the way."
    ,"[1] Now when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples [2] and said to them, \"Go into the village in front of you, and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it. [3] If anyone says to you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.'\" [4] And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street, and they untied it. [5] And some of those standing there said to them, \"What are you doing, untying the colt?\" [6] And they told them what Jesus had said, and they let them go. [7] And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it. [8] And many spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from the fields. [9] And those who went before and those who followed were shouting, \"Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! [10] Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!\"\n\n[11] And he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple. And when he had looked around at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.\n\n[12] On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry. [13] And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. [14] And he said to it, \"May no one ever eat fruit from you again.\" And his disciples heard it.\n\n[15] And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. [16] And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple. [17] And he was teaching them and saying to them, \"Is it not written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations'? But you have made it a den of robbers.\" [18] And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and were seeking a way to destroy him, for they feared him, because all the crowd was astonished at his teaching. [19] And when evening came they went out of the city.\n\n[20] As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots. [21] And Peter remembered and said to him, \"Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered.\" [22] And Jesus answered them, \"Have faith in God. [23] Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him. [24] Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. [25] And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.\"\n\n[27] And they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him, [28] and they said to him, \"By what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority to do them?\" [29] Jesus said to them, \"I will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. [30] Was the baptism of John from heaven or from man? Answer me.\" [31] And they discussed it with one another, saying, \"If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?' [32] But shall we say, 'From man'?\"âthey were afraid of the people, for they all held that John really was a prophet. [33] So they answered Jesus, \"We do not know.\" And Jesus said to them, \"Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\""
    ,"[1] And he began to speak to them in parables. \"A man planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a pit for the winepress and built a tower, and leased it to tenants and went into another country. [2] When the season came, he sent a servant to the tenants to get from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. [3] And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed. [4] Again he sent to them another servant, and they struck him on the head and treated him shamefully. [5] And he sent another, and him they killed. And so with many others: some they beat, and some they killed. [6] He had still one other, a beloved son. Finally he sent him to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' [7] But those tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.' [8] And they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard. [9] What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others. [10] Have you not read this Scripture:\n\n\"'The stone that the builders rejected\nhas become the cornerstone;\n[11] this was the Lord's doing,\nand it is marvelous in our eyes'?\"\n\n[12] And they were seeking to arrest him but feared the people, for they perceived that he had told the parable against them. So they left him and went away.\n\n[13] And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Herodians, to trap him in his talk. [14] And they came and said to him, \"Teacher, we know that you are true and do not care about anyone's opinion. For you are not swayed by appearances, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not?\" [15] But, knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, \"Why put me to the test? Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.\" [16] And they brought one. And he said to them, \"Whose likeness and inscription is this?\" They said to him, \"Caesar's.\" [17] Jesus said to them, \"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\" And they marveled at him.\n\n[18] And Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection. And they asked him a question, saying, [19] \"Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife, but leaves no child, the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. [20] There were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and when he died left no offspring. [21] And the second took her, and died, leaving no offspring. And the third likewise. [22] And the seven left no offspring. Last of all the woman also died. [23] In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.\"\n\n[24] Jesus said to them, \"Is this not the reason you are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God? [25] For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. [26] And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? [27] He is not God of the dead, but of the living. You are quite wrong.\"\n\n[28] And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, \"Which commandment is the most important of all?\" [29] Jesus answered, \"The most important is, 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. [30] And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' [31] The second is this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these.\" [32] And the scribe said to him, \"You are right, Teacher. You have truly said that he is one, and there is no other besides him. [33] And to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" [34] And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, \"You are not far from the kingdom of God.\" And after that no one dared to ask him any more questions.\n\n[35] And as Jesus taught in the temple, he said, \"How can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? [36] David himself, in the Holy Spirit, declared,\n\n\"'The Lord said to my Lord,\n\"Sit at my right hand,\nuntil I put your enemies under your feet.\"'\n\n[37] David himself calls him Lord. So how is he his son?\" And the great throng heard him gladly.\n\n[38] And in his teaching he said, \"Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes and like greetings in the marketplaces [39] and have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts, [40] who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.\"\n\n[41] And he sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting money into the offering box. Many rich people put in large sums. [42] And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which make a penny. [43] And he called his disciples to him and said to them, \"Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box. [44] For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on.\""
    ,"[1] And as he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, \"Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!\" [2] And Jesus said to him, \"Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.\"\n\n[3] And as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, [4] \"Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished?\" [5] And Jesus began to say to them, \"See that no one leads you astray. [6] Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he!' and they will lead many astray. [7] And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. This must take place, but the end is not yet. [8] For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. These are but the beginning of the birth pains.\n\n[9] \"But be on your guard. For they will deliver you over to councils, and you will be beaten in synagogues, and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them. [10] And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all nations. [11] And when they bring you to trial and deliver you over, do not be anxious beforehand what you are to say, but say whatever is given you in that hour, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit. [12] And brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death. [13] And you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.\n\n[14] \"But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where he ought not to be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. [15] Let the one who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter his house, to take anything out, [16] and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. [17] And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! [18] Pray that it may not happen in winter. [19] For in those days there will be such tribulation as has not been from the beginning of the creation that God created until now, and never will be. [20] And if the Lord had not cut short the days, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, whom he chose, he shortened the days. [21] And then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it. [22] For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform signs and wonders, to lead astray, if possible, the elect. [23] But be on guard; I have told you all things beforehand.\n\n[24] \"But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, [25] and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken. [26] And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. [27] And then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.\n\n[28] \"From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near. [29] So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that he is near, at the very gates. [30] Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. [31] Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.\n\n[32] \"But concerning that day or that hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. [33] Be on guard, keep awake. For you do not know when the time will come. [34] It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his servants in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to stay awake. [35] Therefore stay awakeâfor you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morningâ[36] lest he come suddenly and find you asleep. [37] And what I say to you I say to all: Stay awake.\""
    ,"[1] It was now two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest him by stealth and kill him, [2] for they said, \"Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar from the people.\"\n\n[3] And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he was reclining at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and she broke the flask and poured it over his head. [4] There were some who said to themselves indignantly, \"Why was the ointment wasted like that? [5] For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.\" And they scolded her. [6] But Jesus said, \"Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. [7] For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them. But you will not always have me. [8] She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burial. [9] And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.\"\n\n[10] Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them. [11] And when they heard it, they were glad and promised to give him money. And he sought an opportunity to betray him.\n\n[12] And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, \"Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?\" [13] And he sent two of his disciples and said to them, \"Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him, [14] and wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, 'The Teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' [15] And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; there prepare for us.\" [16] And the disciples set out and went to the city and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.\n\n[17] And when it was evening, he came with the twelve. [18] And as they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, \"Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.\" [19] They began to be sorrowful and to say to him one after another, \"Is it I?\" [20] He said to them, \"It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me. [21] For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.\"\n\n[22] And as they were eating, he took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, \"Take; this is my body.\" [23] And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. [24] And he said to them, \"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. [25] Truly, I say to you, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\"\n\n[26] And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. [27] And Jesus said to them, \"You will all fall away, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' [28] But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.\" [29] Peter said to him, \"Even though they all fall away, I will not.\" [30] And Jesus said to him, \"Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.\" [31] But he said emphatically, \"If I must die with you, I will not deny you.\" And they all said the same.\n\n[32] And they went to a place called Gethsemane. And he said to his disciples, \"Sit here while I pray.\" [33] And he took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly distressed and troubled. [34] And he said to them, \"My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch.\" [35] And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. [36] And he said, \"Abba, Father, all things are possible for you. Remove this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.\" [37] And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, \"Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour? [38] Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\" [39] And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words. [40] And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they did not know what to answer him. [41] And he came the third time and said to them, \"Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough; the hour has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. [42] Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.\"\n\n[43] And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. [44] Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, \"The one I will kiss is the man. Seize him and lead him away under guard.\" [45] And when he came, he went up to him at once and said, \"Rabbi!\" And he kissed him. [46] And they laid hands on him and seized him. [47] But one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. [48] And Jesus said to them, \"Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? [49] Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But let the Scriptures be fulfilled.\" [50] And they all left him and fled.\n\n[51] And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth about his body. And they seized him, [52] but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked.\n\n[53] And they led Jesus to the high priest. And all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together. [54] And Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he was sitting with the guards and warming himself at the fire. [55] Now the chief priests and the whole council were seeking testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but they found none. [56] For many bore false witness against him, but their testimony did not agree. [57] And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying, [58] \"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.'\" [59] Yet even about this their testimony did not agree. [60] And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, \"Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?\" [61] But he remained silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, \"Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?\" [62] And Jesus said, \"I am, and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.\" [63] And the high priest tore his garments and said, \"What further witnesses do we need? [64] You have heard his blasphemy. What is your decision?\" And they all condemned him as deserving death. [65] And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to strike him, saying to him, \"Prophesy!\" And the guards received him with blows.\n\n[66] And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came, [67] and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, \"You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.\" [68] But he denied it, saying, \"I neither know nor understand what you mean.\" And he went out into the gateway and the rooster crowed. [69] And the servant girl saw him and began again to say to the bystanders, \"This man is one of them.\" [70] But again he denied it. And after a little while the bystanders again said to Peter, \"Certainly you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.\" [71] But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, \"I do not know this man of whom you speak.\" [72] And immediately the rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him, \"Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.\" And he broke down and wept."
    ,"[1] And as soon as it was morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council. And they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate. [2] And Pilate asked him, \"Are you the King of the Jews?\" And he answered him, \"You have said so.\" [3] And the chief priests accused him of many things. [4] And Pilate again asked him, \"Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you.\" [5] But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed.\n\n[6] Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked. [7] And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas. [8] And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them. [9] And he answered them, saying, \"Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?\" [10] For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up. [11] But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead. [12] And Pilate again said to them, \"Then what shall I do with the man you call the King of the Jews?\" [13] And they cried out again, \"Crucify him.\" [14] And Pilate said to them, \"Why? What evil has he done?\" But they shouted all the more, \"Crucify him.\" [15] So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.\n\n[16] And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the governor's headquarters), and they called together the whole battalion. [17] And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on him. [18] And they began to salute him, \"Hail, King of the Jews!\" [19] And they were striking his head with a reed and spitting on him and kneeling down in homage to him. [20] And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him.\n\n[21] And they compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross. [22] And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull). [23] And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. [24] And they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take. [25] And it was the third hour when they crucified him. [26] And the inscription of the charge against him read, \"The King of the Jews.\" [27] And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left. [29] And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, \"Aha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, [30] save yourself, and come down from the cross!\" [31] So also the chief priests with the scribes mocked him to one another, saying, \"He saved others; he cannot save himself. [32] Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe.\" Those who were crucified with him also reviled him.\n\n[33] And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. [34] And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, \"Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?\" which means, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" [35] And some of the bystanders hearing it said, \"Behold, he is calling Elijah.\" [36] And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, \"Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.\" [37] And Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his last. [38] And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. [39] And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he breathed his last, he said, \"Truly this man was the Son of God!\"\n\n[40] There were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome. [41] When he was in Galilee, they followed him and ministered to him, and there were also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.\n\n[42] And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, [43] Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. [44] Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died. And summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead. [45] And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the corpse to Joseph. [46] And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. [47] Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid."
    ,"[1] When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him. [2] And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb. [3] And they were saying to one another, \"Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?\" [4] And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled backâit was very large. [5] And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed. [6] And he said to them, \"Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him. [7] But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.\" [8] And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them, and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.\n\n[Some of the earliest manuscripts do not include 16:9â20.]\n\n[9] [[Now when he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. [10] She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept. [11] But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it.\n\n[12] After these things he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country. [13] And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them.\n\n[14] Afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen. [15] And he said to them, \"Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. [16] Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. [17] And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; [18] they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.\"\n\n[19] So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. [20] And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by accompanying signs.]]"]
    ,"Luke":
        ["[1] Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things that have been accomplished among us, [2] just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word have delivered them to us, [3] it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely for some time past, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, [4] that you may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught.\n\n[5] In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah. And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. [6] And they were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord. [7] But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years.\n\n[8] Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty, [9] according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. [10] And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. [11] And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. [12] And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. [13] But the angel said to him, \"Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. [14] And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth, [15] for he will be great before the Lord. And he must not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb. [16] And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God, [17] and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.\"\n\n[18] And Zechariah said to the angel, \"How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.\" [19] And the angel answered him, \"I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. [20] And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.\" [21] And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple. [22] And when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them and remained mute. [23] And when his time of service was ended, he went to his home.\n\n[24] After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, saying, [25] \"Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.\"\n\n[26] In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, [27] to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. [28] And he came to her and said, \"Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!\" [29] But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be. [30] And the angel said to her, \"Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. [31] And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. [32] He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, [33] and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.\"\n\n[34] And Mary said to the angel, \"How will this be, since I am a virgin?\"\n\n[35] And the angel answered her, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holyâthe Son of God. [36] And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. [37] For nothing will be impossible with God.\" [38] And Mary said, \"Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.\" And the angel departed from her.\n\n[39] In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a town in Judah, [40] and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. [41] And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, [42] and she exclaimed with a loud cry, \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! [43] And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? [44] For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. [45] And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.\"\n\n[46] And Mary said,\n\n\"My soul magnifies the Lord, [47] and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, [48] for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant. For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed; [49] for he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name. [50] And his mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation. [51] He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts; [52] he has brought down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of humble estate; [53] he has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away empty. [54] He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy, [55] as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his offspring forever.\"\n\n[56] And Mary remained with her about three months and returned to her home.\n\n[57] Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son. [58] And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her. [59] And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. And they would have called him Zechariah after his father, [60] but his mother answered, \"No; he shall be called John.\" [61] And they said to her, \"None of your relatives is called by this name.\" [62] And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he wanted him to be called. [63] And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, \"His name is John.\" And they all wondered. [64] And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God. [65] And fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were talked about through all the hill country of Judea, [66] and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, \"What then will this child be?\" For the hand of the Lord was with him\n\n[67] And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,\n\n[68] \"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has visited and redeemed his people [69] and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David, [70] as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old, [71] that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us; [72] to show the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant, [73] the oath that he swore to our father Abraham, to grant us [74] that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve him without fear, [75] in holiness and righteousness before him all our days. [76] And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways, [77] to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the forgiveness of their sins, [78] because of the tender mercy of our God, whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high [79] to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.\"\n\n[80] And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel."
        ,"[1] In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. [2] This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. [3] And all went to be registered, each to his own town. [4] And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, [5] to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. [6] And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. [7] And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.\n\n[8] And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. [9] And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear. [10] And the angel said to them, \"Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. [11] For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. [12] And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.\" [13] And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,\n\n[14] \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!\"\n\n[15] When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, \"Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.\" [16] And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. [17] And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. [18] And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. [19] But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart. [20] And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.\n\n[21] And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.\n\n[22] And when the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord [23] (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, \"Every male who first opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord\") [24] and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord, \"a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.\" [25] Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. [26] And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. [27] And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law, [28] he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,\n\n[29] \"Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word;\n[30] for my eyes have seen your salvation\n[31] that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,\n[32] a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.\"\n\n[33] And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him. [34] And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, \"Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed [35] (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.\"\n\n[36] And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from when she was a virgin, [37] and then as a widow until she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day. [38] And coming up at that very hour she began to give thanks to God and to speak of him to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.\n\n[39] And when they had performed everything according to the Law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. [40] And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom. And the favor of God was upon him.\n\n[41] Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover. [42] And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom. [43] And when the feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it, [44] but supposing him to be in the group they went a day's journey, but then they began to search for him among their relatives and acquaintances, [45] and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching for him. [46] After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. [47] And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. [48] And when his parents saw him, they were astonished. And his mother said to him, \"Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress.\" [49] And he said to them, \"Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?\" [50] And they did not understand the saying that he spoke to them. [51] And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was submissive to them. And his mother treasured up all these things in her heart.\n\n[52] And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man."
        ,"[1] In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, [2] during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness. [3] And he went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. [4] As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,\n\n\"The voice of one crying in the wilderness:\n'Prepare the way of the Lord,\nmake his paths straight.\n[5] Every valley shall be filled,\nand every mountain and hill shall be made low,\nand the crooked shall become straight,\nand the rough places shall become level ways,\n[6] and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.'\"\n\n[7] He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, \"You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? [8] Bear fruits in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham. [9] Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.\"\n\n[10] And the crowds asked him, \"What then shall we do?\" [11] And he answered them, \"Whoever has two tunics is to share with him who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise.\" [12] Tax collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, \"Teacher, what shall we do?\" [13] And he said to them, \"Collect no more than you are authorized to do.\" [14] Soldiers also asked him, \"And we, what shall we do?\" And he said to them, \"Do not extort money from anyone by threats or by false accusation, and be content with your wages.\"\n\n[15] As the people were in expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Christ, [16] John answered them all, saying, \"I baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I is coming, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. [17] His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.\"\n\n[18] So with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people. [19] But Herod the tetrarch, who had been reproved by him for Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evil things that Herod had done, [20] added this to them all, that he locked up John in prison.\n\n[21] Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened, [22] and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove; and a voice came from heaven, \"You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.\"\n\n[23] Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli, [24] the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, [25] the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai, [26] the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda, [27] the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, [28] the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, [29] the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, [30] the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, [31] the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David, [32] the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Sala, the son of Nahshon, [33] the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Arni, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, [34] the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, [35] the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah, [36] the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, [37] the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan, [38] the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God."
        ,"[1] And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness [2] for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing during those days. And when they were ended, he was hungry. [3] The devil said to him, \"If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.\" [4] And Jesus answered him, \"It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone.'\" [5] And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, [6] and said to him, \"To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will. [7] If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.\" [8] And Jesus answered him, \"It is written,\n\n\"'You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.'\"\n\n[9] And he took him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, \"If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here, [10] for it is written,\n\n\"'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,'\n\n[11] and\n\n\"'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'\"\n\n[12] And Jesus answered him, \"It is said, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'\" [13] And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time.\n\n[14] And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and a report about him went out through all the surrounding country. [15] And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.\n\n[16] And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. And as was his custom, he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and he stood up to read. [17] And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written,\n\n[18] \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,\nbecause he has anointed me\nto proclaim good news to the poor.\nHe has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives\nand recovering of sight to the blind,\nto set at liberty those who are oppressed,\n[19] to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.\"\n\n[20] And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. [21] And he began to say to them, \"Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.\" [22] And all spoke well of him and marveled at the gracious words that were coming from his mouth. And they said, \"Is not this Joseph's son?\" [23] And he said to them, \"Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, '\"Physician, heal yourself.\" What we have heard you did at Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well.'\" [24] And he said, \"Truly, I say to you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown. [25] But in truth, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heavens were shut up three years and six months, and a great famine came over all the land, [26] and Elijah was sent to none of them but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. [27] And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.\" [28] When they heard these things, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath. [29] And they rose up and drove him out of the town and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff. [30] But passing through their midst, he went away.\n\n[31] And he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the Sabbath, [32] and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word possessed authority. [33] And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, [34] \"Ha! What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you areâthe Holy One of God.\" [35] But Jesus rebuked him, saying, \"Be silent and come out of him!\" And when the demon had thrown him down in their midst, he came out of him, having done him no harm. [36] And they were all amazed and said to one another, \"What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!\" [37] And reports about him went out into every place in the surrounding region.\n\n[38] And he arose and left the synagogue and entered Simon's house. Now Simon's mother-in-law was ill with a high fever, and they appealed to him on her behalf. [39] And he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her, and immediately she rose and began to serve them.\n\n[40] Now when the sun was setting, all those who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to him, and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them. [41] And demons also came out of many, crying, \"You are the Son of God!\" But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.\n\n[42] And when it was day, he departed and went into a desolate place. And the people sought him and came to him, and would have kept him from leaving them, [43] but he said to them, \"I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns as well; for I was sent for this purpose.\" [44] And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea."
        ,"[1] On one occasion, while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret, [2] and he saw two boats by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. [3] Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people from the boat. [4] And when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, \"Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.\" [5] And Simon answered, \"Master, we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.\" [6] And when they had done this, they enclosed a large number of fish, and their nets were breaking. [7] They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. [8] But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, \"Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.\" [9] For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken, [10] and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, \"Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.\" [11] And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.\n\n[12] While he was in one of the cities, there came a man full of leprosy. And when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, \"Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.\" [13] And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, \"I will; be clean.\" And immediately the leprosy left him. [14] And he charged him to tell no one, but \"go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a proof to them.\" [15] But now even more the report about him went abroad, and great crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities. [16] But he would withdraw to desolate places and pray.\n\n[17] On one of those days, as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with him to heal. [18] And behold, some men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and lay him before Jesus, [19] but finding no way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus. [20] And when he saw their faith, he said, \"Man, your sins are forgiven you.\" [21] And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, saying, \"Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?\" [22] When Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answered them, \"Why do you question in your hearts? [23] Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'? [24] But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\"âhe said to the man who was paralyzedâ\"I say to you, rise, pick up your bed and go home.\" [25] And immediately he rose up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went home, glorifying God. [26] And amazement seized them all, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, \"We have seen extraordinary things today.\"\n\n[27] After this he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi, sitting at the tax booth. And he said to him, \"Follow me.\" [28] And leaving everything, he rose and followed him.\n\n[29] And Levi made him a great feast in his house, and there was a large company of tax collectors and others reclining at table with them. [30] And the Pharisees and their scribes grumbled at his disciples, saying, \"Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?\" [31] And Jesus answered them, \"Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. [32] I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.\"\n\n[33] And they said to him, \"The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink.\" [34] And Jesus said to them, \"Can you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? [35] The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.\" [36] He also told them a parable: \"No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old garment. If he does, he will tear the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old. [37] And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed. [38] But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins. [39] And no one after drinking old wine desires new, for he says, 'The old is good.'\""
        ,"[1] On a Sabbath, while he was going through the grainfields, his disciples plucked and ate some heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands. [2] But some of the Pharisees said, \"Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?\" [3] And Jesus answered them, \"Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him: [4] how he entered the house of God and took and ate the bread of the Presence, which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those with him?\" [5] And he said to them, \"The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.\"\n\n[6] On another Sabbath, he entered the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was withered. [7] And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might find a reason to accuse him. [8] But he knew their thoughts, and he said to the man with the withered hand, \"Come and stand here.\" And he rose and stood there. [9] And Jesus said to them, \"I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to destroy it?\" [10] And after looking around at them all he said to him, \"Stretch out your hand.\" And he did so, and his hand was restored. [11] But they were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.\n\n[12] In these days he went out to the mountain to pray, and all night he continued in prayer to God. [13] And when day came, he called his disciples and chose from them twelve, whom he named apostles: [14] Simon, whom he named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip, and Bartholomew, [15] and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot, [16] and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.\n\n[17] And he came down with them and stood on a level place, with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, [18] who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. And those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured. [19] And all the crowd sought to touch him, for power came out from him and healed them all.\n\n[20] And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said:\n\n\"Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.\n\n[21] \"Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you shall be satisfied.\n\n\"Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh.\n\n[22] \"Blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as evil, on account of the Son of Man! [23] Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for so their fathers did to the prophets.\n\n[24] \"But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.\n\n[25] \"Woe to you who are full now, for you shall be hungry.\n\n\"Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep.\n\n[26] \"Woe to you, when all people speak well of you, for so their fathers did to the false prophets.\n\n[27] \"But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, [28] bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. [29] To one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also, and from one who takes away your cloak do not withhold your tunic either. [30] Give to everyone who begs from you, and from one who takes away your goods do not demand them back. [31] And as you wish that others would do to you, do so to them.\n\n[32] \"If you love those who love you, what benefit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. [33] And if you do good to those who do good to you, what benefit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. [34] And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to get back the same amount. [35] But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind to the ungrateful and the evil. [36] Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful.\n\n[37] \"Judge not, and you will not be judged; condemn not, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven; [38] give, and it will be given to you. Good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap. For with the measure you use it will be measured back to you.\"\n\n[39] He also told them a parable: \"Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit? [40] A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher. [41] Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? [42] How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye,' when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye.\n\n[43] \"For no good tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit, [44] for each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thornbushes, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush. [45] The good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure produces evil, for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.\n\n[46] \"Why do you call me 'Lord, Lord,' and not do what I tell you? [47] Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you what he is like: [48] he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built. [49] But the one who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the stream broke against it, immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.\""
        ,"[1] After he had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum. [2] Now a centurion had a servant who was sick and at the point of death, who was highly valued by him. [3] When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and heal his servant. [4] And when they came to Jesus, they pleaded with him earnestly, saying, \"He is worthy to have you do this for him, [5] for he loves our nation, and he is the one who built us our synagogue.\" [6] And Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to him, \"Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. [7] Therefore I did not presume to come to you. But say the word, and let my servant be healed. [8] For I too am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me: and I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.\" [9] When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turning to the crowd that followed him, said, \"I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.\" [10] And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant well.\n\n[11] Soon afterward he went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a great crowd went with him. [12] As he drew near to the gate of the town, behold, a man who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow, and a considerable crowd from the town was with her. [13] And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and said to her, \"Do not weep.\" [14] Then he came up and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. And he said, \"Young man, I say to you, arise.\" [15] And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother. [16] Fear seized them all, and they glorified God, saying, \"A great prophet has arisen among us!\" and \"God has visited his people!\" [17] And this report about him spread through the whole of Judea and all the surrounding country.\n\n[18] The disciples of John reported all these things to him. And John, [19] calling two of his disciples to him, sent them to the Lord, saying, \"Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?\" [20] And when the men had come to him, they said, \"John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, 'Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?'\" [21] In that hour he healed many people of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and on many who were blind he bestowed sight. [22] And he answered them, \"Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good news preached to them. [23] And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.\"\n\n[24] When John's messengers had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? [25] What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are dressed in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings' courts. [26] What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. [27] This is he of whom it is written,\n\n\"'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'\n\n[28] I tell you, among those born of women none is greater than John. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\" [29] (When all the people heard this, and the tax collectors too, they declared God just, having been baptized with the baptism of John, [30] but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.)\n\n[31] \"To what then shall I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like? [32] They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another,\n\n\"'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.'\n\n[33] For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.' [34] The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' [35] Yet wisdom is justified by all her children.\"\n\n[36] One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee's house and reclined at table. [37] And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment, [38] and standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment. [39] Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, \"If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner.\" [40] And Jesus answering said to him, \"Simon, I have something to say to you.\" And he answered, \"Say it, Teacher.\"\n\n[41] \"A certain moneylender had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. [42] When they could not pay, he cancelled the debt of both. Now which of them will love him more?\" [43] Simon answered, \"The one, I suppose, for whom he cancelled the larger debt.\" And he said to him, \"You have judged rightly.\" [44] Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon, \"Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. [45] You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet. [46] You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. [47] Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgivenâfor she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little.\" [48] And he said to her, \"Your sins are forgiven.\" [49] Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves, \"Who is this, who even forgives sins?\" [50] And he said to the woman, \"Your faith has saved you; go in peace.\""
        ,"[1] Soon afterward he went on through cities and villages, proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with him, [2] and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, [3] and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's household manager, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their means.\n\n[4] And when a great crowd was gathering and people from town after town came to him, he said in a parable, [5] \"A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell along the path and was trampled underfoot, and the birds of the air devoured it. [6] And some fell on the rock, and as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture. [7] And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it. [8] And some fell into good soil and grew and yielded a hundredfold.\" As he said these things, he called out, \"He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\"\n\n[9] And when his disciples asked him what this parable meant, [10] he said, \"To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God, but for others they are in parables, so that 'seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.' [11] Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. [12] The ones along the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. [13] And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy. But these have no root; they believe for a while, and in time of testing fall away. [14] And as for what fell among the thorns, they are those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature. [15] As for that in the good soil, they are those who, hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and bear fruit with patience.\n\n[16] \"No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light. [17] For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light. [18] Take care then how you hear, for to the one who has, more will be given, and from the one who has not, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away.\"\n\n[19] Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not reach him because of the crowd. [20] And he was told, \"Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you.\" [21] But he answered them, \"My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.\"\n\n[22] One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, \"Let us go across to the other side of the lake.\" So they set out, [23] and as they sailed he fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water and were in danger. [24] And they went and woke him, saying, \"Master, Master, we are perishing!\" And he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves, and they ceased, and there was a calm. [25] He said to them, \"Where is your faith?\" And they were afraid, and they marveled, saying to one another, \"Who then is this, that he commands even winds and water, and they obey him?\"\n\n[26] Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee. [27] When Jesus had stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he had not lived in a house but among the tombs. [28] When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him and said with a loud voice, \"What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me.\" [29] For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many a time it had seized him. He was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert.) [30] Jesus then asked him, \"What is your name?\" And he said, \"Legion,\" for many demons had entered him. [31] And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss. [32] Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him to let them enter these. So he gave them permission. [33] Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.\n\n[34] When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country. [35] Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. [36] And those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been healed. [37] Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned. [38] The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, [39] \"Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you.\" And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.\n\n[40] Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him. [41] And there came a man named Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue. And falling at Jesus' feet, he implored him to come to his house, [42] for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying.\n\nAs Jesus went, the people pressed around him. [43] And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and though she had spent all her living on physicians, she could not be healed by anyone. [44] She came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment, and immediately her discharge of blood ceased. [45] And Jesus said, \"Who was it that touched me?\" When all denied it, Peter said, \"Master, the crowds surround you and are pressing in on you!\" [46] But Jesus said, \"Someone touched me, for I perceive that power has gone out from me.\" [47] And when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed. [48] And he said to her, \"Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.\"\n\n[49] While he was still speaking, someone from the ruler's house came and said, \"Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any more.\" [50] But Jesus on hearing this answered him, \"Do not fear; only believe, and she will be well.\" [51] And when he came to the house, he allowed no one to enter with him, except Peter and John and James, and the father and mother of the child. [52] And all were weeping and mourning for her, but he said, \"Do not weep, for she is not dead but sleeping.\" [53] And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. [54] But taking her by the hand he called, saying, \"Child, arise.\" [55] And her spirit returned, and she got up at once. And he directed that something should be given her to eat. [56] And her parents were amazed, but he charged them to tell no one what had happened."
    ,"[1] And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases, [2] and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal. [3] And he said to them, \"Take nothing for your journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics. [4] And whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart. [5] And wherever they do not receive you, when you leave that town shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.\" [6] And they departed and went through the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.\n\n[7] Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead, [8] by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen. [9] Herod said, \"John I beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?\" And he sought to see him.\n\n[10] On their return the apostles told him all that they had done. And he took them and withdrew apart to a town called Bethsaida. [11] When the crowds learned it, they followed him, and he welcomed them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God and cured those who had need of healing. [12] Now the day began to wear away, and the twelve came and said to him, \"Send the crowd away to go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and get provisions, for we are here in a desolate place.\" [13] But he said to them, \"You give them something to eat.\" They said, \"We have no more than five loaves and two fishâunless we are to go and buy food for all these people.\" [14] For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, \"Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.\" [15] And they did so, and had them all sit down. [16] And taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing over them. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd. [17] And they all ate and were satisfied. And what was left over was picked up, twelve baskets of broken pieces.\n\n[18] Now it happened that as he was praying alone, the disciples were with him. And he asked them, \"Who do the crowds say that I am?\" [19] And they answered, \"John the Baptist. But others say, Elijah, and others, that one of the prophets of old has risen.\" [20] Then he said to them, \"But who do you say that I am?\" And Peter answered, \"The Christ of God.\"\n\n[21] And he strictly charged and commanded them to tell this to no one, [22] saying, \"The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.\"\n\n[23] And he said to all, \"If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. [24] For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. [25] For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself? [26] For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. [27] But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.\"\n\n[28] Now about eight days after these sayings he took with him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray. [29] And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became dazzling white. [30] And behold, two men were talking with him, Moses and Elijah, [31] who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. [32] Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they became fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. [33] And as the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, \"Master, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah\"ânot knowing what he said. [34] As he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. [35] And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, \"This is my Son, my Chosen One; listen to him!\" [36] And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.\n\n[37] On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him. [38] And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, \"Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child. [39] And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out. It convulses him so that he foams at the mouth, and shatters him, and will hardly leave him. [40] And I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.\" [41] Jesus answered, \"O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.\" [42] While he was coming, the demon threw him to the ground and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. [43] And all were astonished at the majesty of God.\n\nBut while they were all marveling at everything he was doing, Jesus said to his disciples, [44] \"Let these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.\" [45] But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them, so that they might not perceive it. And they were afraid to ask him about this saying.\n\n[46] An argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest. [47] But Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a child and put him by his side [48] and said to them, \"Whoever receives this child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For he who is least among you all is the one who is great.\"\n\n[49] John answered, \"Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not follow with us.\" [50] But Jesus said to him, \"Do not stop him, for the one who is not against you is for you.\"\n\n[51] When the days drew near for him to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem. [52] And he sent messengers ahead of him, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make preparations for him. [53] But the people did not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem. [54] And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, \"Lord, do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them?\" [55] But he turned and rebuked them. [56] And they went on to another village.\n\n[57] As they were going along the road, someone said to him, \"I will follow you wherever you go.\" [58] And Jesus said to him, \"Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\" [59] To another he said, \"Follow me.\" But he said, \"Lord, let me first go and bury my father.\" [60] And Jesus said to him, \"Leave the dead to bury their own dead. But as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.\" [61] Yet another said, \"I will follow you, Lord, but let me first say farewell to those at my home.\" [62] Jesus said to him, \"No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.\""
    ,"[1] After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them on ahead of him, two by two, into every town and place where he himself was about to go. [2] And he said to them, \"The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. [3] Go your way; behold, I am sending you out as lambs in the midst of wolves. [4] Carry no moneybag, no knapsack, no sandals, and greet no one on the road. [5] Whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace be to this house!' [6] And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him. But if not, it will return to you. [7] And remain in the same house, eating and drinking what they provide, for the laborer deserves his wages. Do not go from house to house. [8] Whenever you enter a town and they receive you, eat what is set before you. [9] Heal the sick in it and say to them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.' [10] But whenever you enter a town and they do not receive you, go into its streets and say, [11] 'Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near.' [12] I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.\n\n[13] \"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. [14] But it will be more bearable in the judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you. [15] And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades.\n\n[16] \"The one who hears you hears me, and the one who rejects you rejects me, and the one who rejects me rejects him who sent me.\"\n\n[17] The seventy-two returned with joy, saying, \"Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!\" [18] And he said to them, \"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. [19] Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you. [20] Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\"\n\n[21] In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, \"I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will. [22] All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.\"\n\n[23] Then turning to the disciples he said privately, \"Blessed are the eyes that see what you see! [24] For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.\"\n\n[25] And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, \"Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\" [26] He said to him, \"What is written in the Law? How do you read it?\" [27] And he answered, \"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.\" [28] And he said to him, \"You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.\"\n\n[29] But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, \"And who is my neighbor?\" [30] Jesus replied, \"A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead. [31] Now by chance a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him he passed by on the other side. [32] So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. [33] But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion. [34] He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him. [35] And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, 'Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.' [36] Which of these three, do you think, proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?\" [37] He said, \"The one who showed him mercy.\" And Jesus said to him, \"You go, and do likewise.\"\n\n[38] Now as they went on their way, Jesus entered a village. And a woman named Martha welcomed him into her house. [39] And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching. [40] But Martha was distracted with much serving. And she went up to him and said, \"Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me.\" [41] But the Lord answered her, \"Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things, [42] but one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken away from her.\""
    ,"[1] Now Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when he finished, one of his disciples said to him, \"Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.\" [2] And he said to them, \"When you pray, say:\n\n\"Father, hallowed be your name.\nYour kingdom come.\n[3] Give us each day our daily bread,\n[4] and forgive us our sins,\nfor we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us.\nAnd lead us not into temptation.\"\n\n[5] And he said to them, \"Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves, [6] for a friend of mine has arrived on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him'; [7] and he will answer from within, 'Do not bother me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything'? [8] I tell you, though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his impudence he will rise and give him whatever he needs. [9] And I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. [10] For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. [11] What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent; [12] or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? [13] If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!\"\n\n[14] Now he was casting out a demon that was mute. When the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke, and the people marveled. [15] But some of them said, \"He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of demons,\" [16] while others, to test him, kept seeking from him a sign from heaven. [17] But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, \"Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a divided household falls. [18] And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul. [19] And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. [20] But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. [21] When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his goods are safe; [22] but when one stronger than he attacks him and overcomes him, he takes away his armor in which he trusted and divides his spoil. [23] Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.\n\n[24] \"When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and finding none it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' [25] And when it comes, it finds the house swept and put in order. [26] Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there. And the last state of that person is worse than the first.\"\n\n[27] As he said these things, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, \"Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts at which you nursed!\" [28] But he said, \"Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!\"\n\n[29] When the crowds were increasing, he began to say, \"This generation is an evil generation. It seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. [30] For as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation. [31] The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here. [32] The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.\n\n[33] \"No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light. [34] Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is full of light, but when it is bad, your body is full of darkness. [35] Therefore be careful lest the light in you be darkness. [36] If then your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly bright, as when a lamp with its rays gives you light.\"\n\n[37] While Jesus was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him, so he went in and reclined at table. [38] The Pharisee was astonished to see that he did not first wash before dinner. [39] And the Lord said to him, \"Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. [40] You fools! Did not he who made the outside make the inside also? [41] But give as alms those things that are within, and behold, everything is clean for you.\n\n[42] \"But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, and neglect justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others. [43] Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seat in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces. [44] Woe to you! For you are like unmarked graves, and people walk over them without knowing it.\"\n\n[45] One of the lawyers answered him, \"Teacher, in saying these things you insult us also.\" [46] And he said, \"Woe to you lawyers also! For you load people with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers. [47] Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets whom your fathers killed. [48] So you are witnesses and you consent to the deeds of your fathers, for they killed them, and you build their tombs. [49] Therefore also the Wisdom of God said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute,' [50] so that the blood of all the prophets, shed from the foundation of the world, may be charged against this generation, [51] from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation. [52] Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge. You did not enter yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering.\"\n\n[53] As he went away from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press him hard and to provoke him to speak about many things, [54] lying in wait for him, to catch him in something he might say."
    ,"[1] In the meantime, when so many thousands of the people had gathered together that they were trampling one another, he began to say to his disciples first, \"Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. [2] Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. [3] Therefore whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in private rooms shall be proclaimed on the housetops.\n\n[4] \"I tell you, my friends, do not fear those who kill the body, and after that have nothing more that they can do. [5] But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to cast into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him! [6] Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten before God. [7] Why, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; you are of more value than many sparrows.\n\n[8] \"And I tell you, everyone who acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man also will acknowledge before the angels of God, [9] but the one who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God. [10] And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but the one who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. [11] And when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not be anxious about how you should defend yourself or what you should say, [12] for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.\"\n\n[13] Someone in the crowd said to him, \"Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.\" [14] But he said to him, \"Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?\" [15] And he said to them, \"Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.\" [16] And he told them a parable, saying, \"The land of a rich man produced plentifully, [17] and he thought to himself, 'What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?' [18] And he said, 'I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. [19] And I will say to my soul, \"Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.\"' [20] But God said to him, 'Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?' [21] So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.\"\n\n[22] And he said to his disciples, \"Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat, nor about your body, what you will put on. [23] For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing. [24] Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds! [25] And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? [26] If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that, why are you anxious about the rest? [27] Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. [28] But if God so clothes the grass, which is alive in the field today, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith! [29] And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, nor be worried. [30] For all the nations of the world seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need them. [31] Instead, seek his kingdom, and these things will be added to you.\n\n[32] \"Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. [33] Sell your possessions, and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. [34] For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\n\n[35] \"Stay dressed for action and keep your lamps burning, [36] and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast, so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and knocks. [37] Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will dress himself for service and have them recline at table, and he will come and serve them. [38] If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them awake, blessed are those servants! [39] But know this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have left his house to be broken into. [40] You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.\"\n\n[41] Peter said, \"Lord, are you telling this parable for us or for all?\" [42] And the Lord said, \"Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom his master will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the proper time? [43] Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes. [44] Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. [45] But if that servant says to himself, 'My master is delayed in coming,' and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and get drunk, [46] the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces and put him with the unfaithful. [47] And that servant who knew his master's will but did not get ready or act according to his will, will receive a severe beating. [48] But the one who did not know, and did what deserved a beating, will receive a light beating. Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more.\n\n[49] \"I came to cast fire on the earth, and would that it were already kindled! [50] I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how great is my distress until it is accomplished! [51] Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division. [52] For from now on in one house there will be five divided, three against two and two against three. [53] They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.\"\n\n[54] He also said to the crowds, \"When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say at once, 'A shower is coming.' And so it happens. [55] And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, 'There will be scorching heat,' and it happens. [56] You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky, but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?\n\n[57] \"And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right? [58] As you go with your accuser before the magistrate, make an effort to settle with him on the way, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer put you in prison. [59] I tell you, you will never get out until you have paid the very last penny.\""
    ,"[1] There were some present at that very time who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. [2] And he answered them, \"Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered in this way? [3] No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. [4] Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them: do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem? [5] No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.\"\n\n[6] And he told this parable: \"A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none. [7] And he said to the vinedresser, 'Look, for three years now I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I find none. Cut it down. Why should it use up the ground?' [8] And he answered him, 'Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and put on manure. [9] Then if it should bear fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down.'\"\n\n[10] Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. [11] And behold, there was a woman who had had a disabling spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not fully straighten herself. [12] When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said to her, \"Woman, you are freed from your disability.\" [13] And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and she glorified God. [14] But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the people, \"There are six days in which work ought to be done. Come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.\" [15] Then the Lord answered him, \"You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to water it? [16] And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?\" [17] As he said these things, all his adversaries were put to shame, and all the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him.\n\n[18] He said therefore, \"What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it? [19] It is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his garden, and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air made nests in its branches.\"\n\n[20] And again he said, \"To what shall I compare the kingdom of God? [21] It is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened.\"\n\n[22] He went on his way through towns and villages, teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem. [23] And someone said to him, \"Lord, will those who are saved be few?\" And he said to them, [24] \"Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able. [25] When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, open to us,' then he will answer you, 'I do not know where you come from.' [26] Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.' [27] But he will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of evil!' [28] In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves cast out. [29] And people will come from east and west, and from north and south, and recline at table in the kingdom of God. [30] And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.\"\n\n[31] At that very hour some Pharisees came and said to him, \"Get away from here, for Herod wants to kill you.\" [32] And he said to them, \"Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I finish my course. [33] Nevertheless, I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the day following, for it cannot be that a prophet should perish away from Jerusalem.' [34] O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing! [35] Behold, your house is forsaken. And I tell you, you will not see me until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'\""
    ,"[1] One Sabbath, when he went to dine at the house of a ruler of the Pharisees, they were watching him carefully. [2] And behold, there was a man before him who had dropsy. [3] And Jesus responded to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, \"Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?\" [4] But they remained silent. Then he took him and healed him and sent him away. [5] And he said to them, \"Which of you, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day, will not immediately pull him out?\" [6] And they could not reply to these things.\n\n[7] Now he told a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the places of honor, saying to them, [8] \"When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in a place of honor, lest someone more distinguished than you be invited by him, [9] and he who invited you both will come and say to you, 'Give your place to this person,' and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place. [10] But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when your host comes he may say to you, 'Friend, move up higher.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you. [11] For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.\"\n\n[12] He said also to the man who had invited him, \"When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and you be repaid. [13] But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, [14] and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.\"\n\n[15] When one of those who reclined at table with him heard these things, he said to him, \"Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!\" [16] But he said to him, \"A man once gave a great banquet and invited many. [17] And at the time for the banquet he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited, 'Come, for everything is now ready.' [18] But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, 'I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it. Please have me excused.' [19] And another said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to examine them. Please have me excused.' [20] And another said, 'I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.' [21] So the servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house became angry and said to his servant, 'Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor and crippled and blind and lame.' [22] And the servant said, 'Sir, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.' [23] And the master said to the servant, 'Go out to the highways and hedges and compel people to come in, that my house may be filled. [24] For I tell you, none of those men who were invited shall taste my banquet.'\"\n\n[25] Now great crowds accompanied him, and he turned and said to them, [26] \"If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple. [27] Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple. [28] For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it? [29] Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him, [30] saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.' [31] Or what king, going out to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? [32] And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace. [33] So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.\n\n[34] \"Salt is good, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? [35] It is of no use either for the soil or for the manure pile. It is thrown away. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\""
    ,"[1] Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him. [2] And the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled, saying, \"This man receives sinners and eats with them.\"\n\n[3] So he told them this parable: [4] \"What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open country, and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it? [5] And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. [6] And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.' [7] Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.\n\n[8] \"Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it? [9] And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.' [10] Just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.\"\n\n[11] And he said, \"There was a man who had two sons. [12] And the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of property that is coming to me.' And he divided his property between them. [13] Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in reckless living. [14] And when he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in need. [15] So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. [16] And he was longing to be fed with the pods that the pigs ate, and no one gave him anything.\n\n[17] \"But when he came to himself, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger! [18] I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, \"Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. [19] I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat me as one of your hired servants.\"' [20] And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. [21] And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.' [22] But the father said to his servants, 'Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet. [23] And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate. [24] For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.' And they began to celebrate.\n\n[25] \"Now his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. [26] And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant. [27] And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.' [28] But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him, [29] but he answered his father, 'Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might celebrate with my friends. [30] But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!' [31] And he said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. [32] It was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.'\""
    ,"[1] He also said to the disciples, \"There was a rich man who had a manager, and charges were brought to him that this man was wasting his possessions. [2] And he called him and said to him, 'What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the account of your management, for you can no longer be manager.' [3] And the manager said to himself, 'What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. [4] I have decided what to do, so that when I am removed from management, people may receive me into their houses.' [5] So, summoning his master's debtors one by one, he said to the first, 'How much do you owe my master?' [6] He said, 'A hundred measures of oil.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.' [7] Then he said to another, 'And how much do you owe?' He said, 'A hundred measures of wheat.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.' [8] The master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewdness. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light. [9] And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.\n\n[10] \"One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much. [11] If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches? [12] And if you have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own? [13] No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.\"\n\n[14] The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they ridiculed him. [15] And he said to them, \"You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.\n\n[16] \"The Law and the Prophets were until John; since then the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone forces his way into it. [17] But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to become void.\n\n[18] \"Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.\n\n[19] \"There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. [20] And at his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, [21] who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores. [22] The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried, [23] and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side. [24] And he called out, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.' [25] But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. [26] And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.' [27] And he said, 'Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father's houseâ[28] for I have five brothersâso that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.' [29] But Abraham said, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.' [30] And he said, 'No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.' [31] He said to him, 'If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.'\""
    ,"[1] And he said to his disciples, \"Temptations to sin are sure to come, but woe to the one through whom they come! [2] It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin. [3] Pay attention to yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him, [4] and if he sins against you seven times in the day, and turns to you seven times, saying, 'I repent,' you must forgive him.\"\n\n[5] The apostles said to the Lord, \"Increase our faith!\" [6] And the Lord said, \"If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it would obey you.\n\n[7] \"Will any one of you who has a servant plowing or keeping sheep say to him when he has come in from the field, 'Come at once and recline at table'? [8] Will he not rather say to him, 'Prepare supper for me, and dress properly, and serve me while I eat and drink, and afterward you will eat and drink'? [9] Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded? [10] So you also, when you have done all that you were commanded, say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty.'\"\n\n[11] On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee. [12] And as he entered a village, he was met by ten lepers, who stood at a distance [13] and lifted up their voices, saying, \"Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.\" [14] When he saw them he said to them, \"Go and show yourselves to the priests.\" And as they went they were cleansed. [15] Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice; [16] and he fell on his face at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan. [17] Then Jesus answered, \"Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine? [18] Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?\" [19] And he said to him, \"Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well.\"\n\n[20] Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them, \"The kingdom of God is not coming in ways that can be observed, [21] nor will they say, 'Look, here it is!' or 'There!' for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.\"\n\n[22] And he said to the disciples, \"The days are coming when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it. [23] And they will say to you, 'Look, there!' or 'Look, here!' Do not go out or follow them. [24] For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his day. [25] But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. [26] Just as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of Man. [27] They were eating and drinking and marrying and being given in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. [28] Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lotâthey were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building, [29] but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom, fire and sulfur rained from heaven and destroyed them allâ[30] so will it be on the day when the Son of Man is revealed. [31] On that day, let the one who is on the housetop, with his goods in the house, not come down to take them away, and likewise let the one who is in the field not turn back. [32] Remember Lot's wife. [33] Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will keep it. [34] I tell you, in that night there will be two in one bed. One will be taken and the other left. [35] There will be two women grinding together. One will be taken and the other left.\" [37] And they said to him, \"Where, Lord?\" He said to them, \"Where the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.\""
    ,"[1] And he told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart. [2] He said, \"In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected man. [3] And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, 'Give me justice against my adversary.' [4] For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself, 'Though I neither fear God nor respect man, [5] yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will give her justice, so that she will not beat me down by her continual coming.'\" [6] And the Lord said, \"Hear what the unrighteous judge says. [7] And will not God give justice to his elect, who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them? [8] I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?\"\n\n[9] He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt: [10] \"Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. [11] The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. [12] I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.' [13] But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner!' [14] I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.\"\n\n[15] Now they were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them. And when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. [16] But Jesus called them to him, saying, \"Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. [17] Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.\"\n\n[18] And a ruler asked him, \"Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" [19] And Jesus said to him, \"Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. [20] You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.'\" [21] And he said, \"All these I have kept from my youth.\" [22] When Jesus heard this, he said to him, \"One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.\" [23] But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich. [24] Jesus, seeing that he had become sad, said, \"How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! [25] For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.\" [26] Those who heard it said, \"Then who can be saved?\" [27] But he said, \"What is impossible with man is possible with God.\" [28] And Peter said, \"See, we have left our homes and followed you.\" [29] And he said to them, \"Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, [30] who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life.\"\n\n[31] And taking the twelve, he said to them, \"See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished. [32] For he will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon. [33] And after flogging him, they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise.\" [34] But they understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what was said.\n\n[35] As he drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. [36] And hearing a crowd going by, he inquired what this meant. [37] They told him, \"Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.\" [38] And he cried out, \"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!\" [39] And those who were in front rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, \"Son of David, have mercy on me!\" [40] And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him, [41] \"What do you want me to do for you?\" He said, \"Lord, let me recover my sight.\" [42] And Jesus said to him, \"Recover your sight; your faith has made you well.\" [43] And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God."
    ,"[1] He entered Jericho and was passing through. [2] And behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector and was rich. [3] And he was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was small in stature. [4] So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was about to pass that way. [5] And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, \"Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today.\" [6] So he hurried and came down and received him joyfully. [7] And when they saw it, they all grumbled, \"He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.\" [8] And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, \"Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold.\" [9] And Jesus said to him, \"Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham. [10] For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.\"\n\n[11] As they heard these things, he proceeded to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately. [12] He said therefore, \"A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return. [13] Calling ten of his servants, he gave them ten minas, and said to them, 'Engage in business until I come.' [14] But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We do not want this man to reign over us.' [15] When he returned, having received the kingdom, he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by doing business. [16] The first came before him, saying, 'Lord, your mina has made ten minas more.' [17] And he said to him, 'Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.' [18] And the second came, saying, 'Lord, your mina has made five minas.' [19] And he said to him, 'And you are to be over five cities.' [20] Then another came, saying, 'Lord, here is your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief; [21] for I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man. You take what you did not deposit, and reap what you did not sow.' [22] He said to him, 'I will condemn you with your own words, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a severe man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow? [23] Why then did you not put my money in the bank, and at my coming I might have collected it with interest?' [24] And he said to those who stood by, 'Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas.' [25] And they said to him, 'Lord, he has ten minas!' [26] 'I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. [27] But as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slaughter them before me.'\"\n\n[28] And when he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. [29] When he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples, [30] saying, \"Go into the village in front of you, where on entering you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever yet sat. Untie it and bring it here. [31] If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' you shall say this: 'The Lord has need of it.'\" [32] So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them. [33] And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, \"Why are you untying the colt?\" [34] And they said, \"The Lord has need of it.\" [35] And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks on the colt, they set Jesus on it. [36] And as he rode along, they spread their cloaks on the road. [37] As he was drawing nearâalready on the way down the Mount of Olivesâthe whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen, [38] saying, \"Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!\" [39] And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, \"Teacher, rebuke your disciples.\" [40] He answered, \"I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.\"\n\n[41] And when he drew near and saw the city, he wept over it, [42] saying, \"Would that you, even you, had known on this day the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes. [43] For the days will come upon you, when your enemies will set up a barricade around you and surround you and hem you in on every side [44] and tear you down to the ground, you and your children within you. And they will not leave one stone upon another in you, because you did not know the time of your visitation.\"\n\n[45] And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold, [46] saying to them, \"It is written, 'My house shall be a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of robbers.\"\n\n[47] And he was teaching daily in the temple. The chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people were seeking to destroy him, [48] but they did not find anything they could do, for all the people were hanging on his words."
    ,"[1] One day, as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came up [2] and said to him, \"Tell us by what authority you do these things, or who it is that gave you this authority.\" [3] He answered them, \"I also will ask you a question. Now tell me, [4] was the baptism of John from heaven or from man?\" [5] And they discussed it with one another, saying, \"If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why did you not believe him?' [6] But if we say, 'From man,' all the people will stone us to death, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.\" [7] So they answered that they did not know where it came from. [8] And Jesus said to them, \"Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\"\n\n[9] And he began to tell the people this parable: \"A man planted a vineyard and let it out to tenants and went into another country for a long while. [10] When the time came, he sent a servant to the tenants, so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed. [11] And he sent another servant. But they also beat and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed. [12] And he sent yet a third. This one also they wounded and cast out. [13] Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.' [14] But when the tenants saw him, they said to themselves, 'This is the heir. Let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.' [15] And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? [16] He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.\" When they heard this, they said, \"Surely not!\" [17] But he looked directly at them and said, \"What then is this that is written:\n\n\"'The stone that the builders rejected\nhas become the cornerstone'?\n\n[18] Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.\"\n\n[19] The scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him at that very hour, for they perceived that he had told this parable against them, but they feared the people. [20] So they watched him and sent spies, who pretended to be sincere, that they might catch him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor. [21] So they asked him, \"Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and show no partiality, but truly teach the way of God. [22] Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?\" [23] But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, [24] \"Show me a denarius. Whose likeness and inscription does it have?\" They said, \"Caesar's.\" [25] He said to them, \"Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\" [26] And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him in what he said, but marveling at his answer they became silent.\n\n[27] There came to him some Sadducees, those who deny that there is a resurrection, [28] and they asked him a question, saying, \"Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies, having a wife but no children, the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. [29] Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died without children. [30] And the second [31] and the third took her, and likewise all seven left no children and died. [32] Afterward the woman also died. [33] In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had her as wife.\"\n\n[34] And Jesus said to them, \"The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage, [35] but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage, [36] for they cannot die anymore, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. [37] But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. [38] Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him.\" [39] Then some of the scribes answered, \"Teacher, you have spoken well.\" [40] For they no longer dared to ask him any question.\n\n[41] But he said to them, \"How can they say that the Christ is David's son? [42] For David himself says in the Book of Psalms,\n\n\"'The Lord said to my Lord,\n\"Sit at my right hand,\n[43] until I make your enemies your footstool.\"'\n\n[44] David thus calls him Lord, so how is he his son?\"\n\n[45] And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples, [46] \"Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts, [47] who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.\""
    ,"[1] Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the offering box, [2] and he saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins. [3] And he said, \"Truly, I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them. [4] For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on.\"\n\n[5] And while some were speaking of the temple, how it was adorned with noble stones and offerings, he said, [6] \"As for these things that you see, the days will come when there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.\" [7] And they asked him, \"Teacher, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?\" [8] And he said, \"See that you are not led astray. For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he!' and, 'The time is at hand!' Do not go after them. [9] And when you hear of wars and tumults, do not be terrified, for these things must first take place, but the end will not be at once.\"\n\n[10] Then he said to them, \"Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. [11] There will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences. And there will be terrors and great signs from heaven. [12] But before all this they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors for my name's sake. [13] This will be your opportunity to bear witness. [14] Settle it therefore in your minds not to meditate beforehand how to answer, [15] for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict. [16] You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and some of you they will put to death. [17] You will be hated by all for my name's sake. [18] But not a hair of your head will perish. [19] By your endurance you will gain your lives.\n\n[20] \"But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near. [21] Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are inside the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it, [22] for these are days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written. [23] Alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! For there will be great distress upon the earth and wrath against this people. [24] They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive among all nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.\n\n[25] \"And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity because of the roaring of the sea and the waves, [26] people fainting with fear and with foreboding of what is coming on the world. For the powers of the heavens will be shaken. [27] And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. [28] Now when these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.\"\n\n[29] And he told them a parable: \"Look at the fig tree, and all the trees. [30] As soon as they come out in leaf, you see for yourselves and know that the summer is already near. [31] So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near. [32] Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all has taken place. [33] Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.\n\n[34] \"But watch yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly like a trap. [35] For it will come upon all who dwell on the face of the whole earth. [36] But stay awake at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.\"\n\n[37] And every day he was teaching in the temple, but at night he went out and lodged on the mount called Olivet. [38] And early in the morning all the people came to him in the temple to hear him."
    ,"[1] Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called the Passover. [2] And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to put him to death, for they feared the people.\n\n[3] Then Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve. [4] He went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers how he might betray him to them. [5] And they were glad, and agreed to give him money. [6] So he consented and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of a crowd.\n\n[7] Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. [8] So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, \"Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat it.\" [9] They said to him, \"Where will you have us prepare it?\" [10] He said to them, \"Behold, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters [11] and tell the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' [12] And he will show you a large upper room furnished; prepare it there.\" [13] And they went and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.\n\n[14] And when the hour came, he reclined at table, and the apostles with him. [15] And he said to them, \"I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. [16] For I tell you I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.\" [17] And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he said, \"Take this, and divide it among yourselves. [18] For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\" [19] And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, \"This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.\" [20] And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, \"This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. [21] But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table. [22] For the Son of Man goes as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!\" [23] And they began to question one another, which of them it could be who was going to do this.\n\n[24] A dispute also arose among them, as to which of them was to be regarded as the greatest. [25] And he said to them, \"The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those in authority over them are called benefactors. [26] But not so with you. Rather, let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves. [27] For who is the greater, one who reclines at table or one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am among you as the one who serves.\n\n[28] \"You are those who have stayed with me in my trials, [29] and I assign to you, as my Father assigned to me, a kingdom, [30] that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\n\n[31] \"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, [32] but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.\" [33] Peter said to him, \"Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death.\" [34] Jesus said, \"I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day, until you deny three times that you know me.\"\n\n[35] And he said to them, \"When I sent you out with no moneybag or knapsack or sandals, did you lack anything?\" They said, \"Nothing.\" [36] He said to them, \"But now let the one who has a moneybag take it, and likewise a knapsack. And let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one. [37] For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors.' For what is written about me has its fulfillment.\" [38] And they said, \"Look, Lord, here are two swords.\" And he said to them, \"It is enough.\"\n\n[39] And he came out and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him. [40] And when he came to the place, he said to them, \"Pray that you may not enter into temptation.\" [41] And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and knelt down and prayed, [42] saying, \"Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.\" [43] And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. [44] And being in agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground. [45] And when he rose from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow, [46] and he said to them, \"Why are you sleeping? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.\"\n\n[47] While he was still speaking, there came a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss him, [48] but Jesus said to him, \"Judas, would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?\" [49] And when those who were around him saw what would follow, they said, \"Lord, shall we strike with the sword?\" [50] And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. [51] But Jesus said, \"No more of this!\" And he touched his ear and healed him. [52] Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders, who had come out against him, \"Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? [53] When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.\"\n\n[54] Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest's house, and Peter was following at a distance. [55] And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them. [56] Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely at him, said, \"This man also was with him.\" [57] But he denied it, saying, \"Woman, I do not know him.\" [58] And a little later someone else saw him and said, \"You also are one of them.\" But Peter said, \"Man, I am not.\" [59] And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying, \"Certainly this man also was with him, for he too is a Galilean.\" [60] But Peter said, \"Man, I do not know what you are talking about.\" And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed. [61] And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him, \"Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.\" [62] And he went out and wept bitterly.\n\n[63] Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking him as they beat him. [64] They also blindfolded him and kept asking him, \"Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?\" [65] And they said many other things against him, blaspheming him.\n\n[66] When day came, the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes. And they led him away to their council, and they said, [67] \"If you are the Christ, tell us.\" But he said to them, \"If I tell you, you will not believe, [68] and if I ask you, you will not answer. [69] But from now on the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God.\" [70] So they all said, \"Are you the Son of God, then?\" And he said to them, \"You say that I am.\" [71] Then they said, \"What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips.\""
    ,"[1] Then the whole company of them arose and brought him before Pilate. [2] And they began to accuse him, saying, \"We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.\" [3] And Pilate asked him, \"Are you the King of the Jews?\" And he answered him, \"You have said so.\" [4] Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, \"I find no guilt in this man.\" [5] But they were urgent, saying, \"He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place.\"\n\n[6] When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. [7] And when he learned that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time. [8] When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign done by him. [9] So he questioned him at some length, but he made no answer. [10] The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him. [11] And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him. Then, arraying him in splendid clothing, he sent him back to Pilate. [12] And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.\n\n[13] Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, [14] and said to them, \"You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people. And after examining him before you, behold, I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him. [15] Neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Look, nothing deserving death has been done by him. [16] I will therefore punish and release him.\"\n\n[18] But they all cried out together, \"Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas\"â[19] a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city and for murder. [20] Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus, [21] but they kept shouting, \"Crucify, crucify him!\" [22] A third time he said to them, \"Why? What evil has he done? I have found in him no guilt deserving death. I will therefore punish and release him.\" [23] But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified. And their voices prevailed. [24] So Pilate decided that their demand should be granted. [25] He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus over to their will.\n\n[26] And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus. [27] And there followed him a great multitude of the people and of women who were mourning and lamenting for him. [28] But turning to them Jesus said, \"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. [29] For behold, the days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!' [30] Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us,' and to the hills, 'Cover us.' [31] For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?\"\n\n[32] Two others, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him. [33] And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. [34] And Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\" And they cast lots to divide his garments. [35] And the people stood by, watching, but the rulers scoffed at him, saying, \"He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One!\" [36] The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine [37] and saying, \"If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!\" [38] There was also an inscription over him, \"This is the King of the Jews.\"\n\n[39] One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, \"Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!\" [40] But the other rebuked him, saying, \"Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? [41] And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.\" [42] And he said, \"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\" [43] And he said to him, \"Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.\"\n\n[44] It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour, [45] while the sun's light failed. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. [46] Then Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, \"Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!\" And having said this he breathed his last. [47] Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God, saying, \"Certainly this man was innocent!\" [48] And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts. [49] And all his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance watching these things.\n\n[50] Now there was a man named Joseph, from the Jewish town of Arimathea. He was a member of the council, a good and righteous man, [51] who had not consented to their decision and action; and he was looking for the kingdom of God. [52] This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. [53] Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud and laid him in a tomb cut in stone, where no one had ever yet been laid. [54] It was the day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was beginning. [55] The women who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was laid. [56] Then they returned and prepared spices and ointments.\n\nOn the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment."
    ,"[1] But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared. [2] And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, [3] but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. [4] While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel. [5] And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, \"Why do you seek the living among the dead? [6] He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, [7] that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.\" [8] And they remembered his words, [9] and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. [10] Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles, [11] but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. [12] But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened.\n\n[13] That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, [14] and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened. [15] While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. [16] But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. [17] And he said to them, \"What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?\" And they stood still, looking sad. [18] Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, \"Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?\" [19] And he said to them, \"What things?\" And they said to him, \"Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, [20] and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. [21] But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. [22] Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, [23] and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. [24] Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.\" [25] And he said to them, \"O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! [26] Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?\" [27] And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.\n\n[28] So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther, [29] but they urged him strongly, saying, \"Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.\" So he went in to stay with them. [30] When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them. [31] And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight. [32] They said to each other, \"Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?\" [33] And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, [34] saying, \"The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!\" [35] Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.\n\n[36] As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, \"Peace to you!\" [37] But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit. [38] And he said to them, \"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? [39] See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.\" [40] And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. [41] And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling, he said to them, \"Have you anything here to eat?\" [42] They gave him a piece of broiled fish, [43] and he took it and ate before them.\n\n[44] Then he said to them, \"These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.\" [45] Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, [46] and said to them, \"Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, [47] and that repentance for the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. [48] You are witnesses of these things. [49] And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.\"\n\n[50] And he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them. [51] While he blessed them, he parted from them and was carried up into heaven. [52] And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, [53] and were continually in the temple blessing God."

    ,"John":
    ["[1] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. [2] He was in the beginning with God. [3] All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. [4] In him was life, and the life was the light of men. [5] The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.\n\n[6] There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. [7] He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. [8] He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.\n\n[9] The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. [10] He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. [11] He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. [12] But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, [13] who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.\n\n[14] And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. [15] (John bore witness about him, and cried out, âThis was he of whom I said, âHe who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.ââ) [16] For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. [17] For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. [18] No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known.\n\n[19] And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, âWho are you?â [20] He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, âI am not the Christ.â [21] And they asked him, âWhat then? Are you Elijah?â He said, âI am not.â âAre you the Prophet?â And he answered, âNo.â [22] So they said to him, âWho are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?â [23] He said, âI am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, âMake straight the way of the Lord,â as the prophet Isaiah said.â\n\n[24] (Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.) [25] They asked him, âThen why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?â [26] John answered them, âI baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know, [27] even he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.â [28] These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.\n\n[29] The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, âBehold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! [30] This is he of whom I said, âAfter me comes a man who ranks before me, because he was before me.â [31] I myself did not know him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.â [32] And John bore witness: âI saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him. [33] I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, âHe on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.â [34] And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.â\n\n[35] The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples, [36] and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said, âBehold, the Lamb of God!â [37] The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus. [38] Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, âWhat are you seeking?â And they said to him, âRabbiâ (which means Teacher), âwhere are you staying?â [39] He said to them, âCome and you will see.â So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour. [40] One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. [41] He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, âWe have found the Messiahâ (which means Christ). [42] He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, âYou are Simon the son of John. You shall be called Cephasâ (which means Peter).\n\n[43] The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, âFollow me.â [44] Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. [45] Philip found Nathanael and said to him, âWe have found him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.â [46] Nathanael said to him, âCan anything good come out of Nazareth?â Philip said to him, âCome and see.â [47] Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, âBehold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!â [48] Nathanael said to him, âHow do you know me?â Jesus answered him, âBefore Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.â [49] Nathanael answered him, âRabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!â [50] Jesus answered him, âBecause I said to you, âI saw you under the fig tree,â do you believe? You will see greater things than these.â [51] And he said to him, âTruly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.â"
        ,"[1] On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. [2] Jesus also was invited to the wedding with his disciples. [3] When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, âThey have no wine.â [4] And Jesus said to her, âWoman, what does this have to do with me? My hour has not yet come.â [5] His mother said to the servants, âDo whatever he tells you.â\n\n[6] Now there were six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. [7] Jesus said to the servants, âFill the jars with water.â And they filled them up to the brim. [8] And he said to them, âNow draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.â So they took it. [9] When the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom [10] and said to him, âEveryone serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine. But you have kept the good wine until now.â [11] This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him.\n\n[12] After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and they stayed there for a few days.\n\n[13] The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. [14] In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there. [15] And making a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen. And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables. [16] And he told those who sold the pigeons, âTake these things away; do not make my Father's house a house of trade.â [17] His disciples remembered that it was written, âZeal for your house will consume me.â\n\n[18] So the Jews said to him, âWhat sign do you show us for doing these things?â [19] Jesus answered them, âDestroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.â [20] The Jews then said, âIt has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?â [21] But he was speaking about the temple of his body. [22] When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.\n\n[23] Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many believed in his name when they saw the signs that he was doing. [24] But Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people [25] and needed no one to bear witness about man, for he himself knew what was in man."
    ,"[1] Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. [2] This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, âRabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.â [3] Jesus answered him, âTruly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.â [4] Nicodemus said to him, âHow can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?â [5] Jesus answered, âTruly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. [6] That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. [7] Do not marvel that I said to you, âYou must be born again.â [8] The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.â\n\n[9] Nicodemus said to him, âHow can these things be?â [10] Jesus answered him, âAre you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things? [11] Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony. [12] If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things? [13] No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man. [14] And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, [15] that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.\n\n[16] âFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. [17] For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. [18] Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. [19] And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. [20] For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. [21] But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.â\n\n[22] After this Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside, and he remained there with them and was baptizing. [23] John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and people were coming and being baptized [24] (for John had not yet been put in prison).\n\n[25] Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a Jew over purification. [26] And they came to John and said to him, âRabbi, he who was with you across the Jordan, to whom you bore witnessâlook, he is baptizing, and all are going to him.â [27] John answered, âA person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven. [28] You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, âI am not the Christ, but I have been sent before him.â [29] The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice. Therefore this joy of mine is now complete. [30] He must increase, but I must decrease.â\n\n[31] He who comes from above is above all. He who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks in an earthly way. He who comes from heaven is above all. [32] He bears witness to what he has seen and heard, yet no one receives his testimony. [33] Whoever receives his testimony sets his seal to this, that God is true. [34] For he whom God has sent utters the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure. [35] The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand. [36] Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him."
    ,"[1] Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John [2] (although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples), [3] he left Judea and departed again for Galilee. [4] And he had to pass through Samaria. [5] So he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. [6] Jacob's well was there; so Jesus, wearied as he was from his journey, was sitting beside the well. It was about the sixth hour.\n\n[7] A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, âGive me a drink.â [8] (For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.) [9] The Samaritan woman said to him, âHow is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria?â (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) [10] Jesus answered her, âIf you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, âGive me a drink,â you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.â [11] The woman said to him, âSir, you have nothing to draw water with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water? [12] Are you greater than our father Jacob? He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock.â [13] Jesus said to her, âEveryone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, [14] but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again. The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.â [15] The woman said to him, âSir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.â\n\n[16] Jesus said to her, âGo, call your husband, and come here.â [17] The woman answered him, âI have no husband.â Jesus said to her, âYou are right in saying, âI have no husbandâ; [18] for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.â [19] The woman said to him, âSir, I perceive that you are a prophet. [20] Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.â [21] Jesus said to her, âWoman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. [22] You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. [23] But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him. [24] God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.â [25] The woman said to him, âI know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, he will tell us all things.â [26] Jesus said to her, âI who speak to you am he.â\n\n[27] Just then his disciples came back. They marveled that he was talking with a woman, but no one said, âWhat do you seek?â or, âWhy are you talking with her?â [28] So the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people, [29] âCome, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?â [30] They went out of the town and were coming to him.\n\n[31] Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying, âRabbi, eat.â [32] But he said to them, âI have food to eat that you do not know about.â [33] So the disciples said to one another, âHas anyone brought him something to eat?â [34] Jesus said to them, âMy food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work. [35] Do you not say, âThere are yet four months, then comes the harvestâ? Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see that the fields are white for harvest. [36] Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together. [37] For here the saying holds true, âOne sows and another reaps.â [38] I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.â\n\n[39] Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, âHe told me all that I ever did.â [40] So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days. [41] And many more believed because of his word. [42] They said to the woman, âIt is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world.â\n\n[43] After the two days he departed for Galilee. [44] (For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.) [45] So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast. For they too had gone to the feast.\n\n[46] So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was ill. [47] When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. [48] So Jesus said to him, âUnless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.â [49] The official said to him, âSir, come down before my child dies.â [50] Jesus said to him, âGo; your son will live.â The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way. [51] As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was recovering. [52] So he asked them the hour when he began to get better, and they said to him, âYesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.â [53] The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, âYour son will live.â And he himself believed, and all his household. [54] This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee."
    ,"[1] After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.\n\n[2] Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, in Aramaic called Bethesda, which has five roofed colonnades. [3] In these lay a multitude of invalidsâblind, lame, and paralyzed. [5] One man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. [6] When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, he said to him, âDo you want to be healed?â [7] The sick man answered him, âSir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am going another steps down before me.â [8] Jesus said to him, âGet up, take up your bed, and walk.â [9] And at once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked.\n\nNow that day was the Sabbath. [10] So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, âIt is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your bed.â [11] But he answered them, âThe man who healed me, that man said to me, âTake up your bed, and walk.ââ [12] They asked him, âWho is the man who said to you, âTake up your bed and walkâ?â [13] Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place. [14] Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, âSee, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse may happen to you.â [15] The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him. [16] And this was why the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath. [17] But Jesus answered them, âMy Father is working until now, and I am working.â\n\n[18] This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.\n\n[19] So Jesus said to them, âTruly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise. [20] For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing. And greater works than these will he show him, so that you may marvel. [21] For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will. [22] For the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, [23] that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him. [24] Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.\n\n[25] âTruly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. [26] For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself. [27] And he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man. [28] Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice [29] and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.\n\n[30] âI can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me. [31] If I alone bear witness about myself, my testimony is not true. [32] There is another who bears witness about me, and I know that the testimony that he bears about me is true. [33] You sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth. [34] Not that the testimony that I receive is from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved. [35] He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. [36] But the testimony that I have is greater than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works that I am doing, bear witness about me that the Father has sent me. [37] And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness about me. His voice you have never heard, his form you have never seen, [38] and you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe the one whom he has sent. [39] You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, [40] yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life. [41] I do not receive glory from people. [42] But I know that you do not have the love of God within you. [43] I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him. [44] How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? [45] Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you: Moses, on whom you have set your hope. [46] For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me. [47] But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?â"
    ,"[1] After this Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias. [2] And a large crowd was following him, because they saw the signs that he was doing on the sick. [3] Jesus went up on the mountain, and there he sat down with his disciples. [4] Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand. [5] Lifting up his eyes, then, and seeing that a large crowd was coming toward him, Jesus said to Philip, âWhere are we to buy bread, so that these people may eat?â [6] He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he would do. [7] Philip answered him, âTwo hundred denarii worth of bread would not be enough for each of them to get a little.â [8] One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him, [9] âThere is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are they for so many?â [10] Jesus said, âHave the people sit down.â Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, about five thousand in number. [11] Jesus then took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated. So also the fish, as much as they wanted. [12] And when they had eaten their fill, he told his disciples, âGather up the leftover fragments, that nothing may be lost.â [13] So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten. [14] When the people saw the sign that he had done, they said, âThis is indeed the Prophet who is to come into the world!â\n\n[15] Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself.\n\n[16] When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea, [17] got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. [18] The sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing. [19] When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were frightened. [20] But he said to them, âIt is I; do not be afraid.â [21] Then they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.\n\n[22] On the next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone. [23] Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. [24] So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.\n\n[25] When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, âRabbi, when did you come here?â [26] Jesus answered them, âTruly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves. [27] Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For on him God the Father has set his seal.â [28] Then they said to him, âWhat must we do, to be doing the works of God?â [29] Jesus answered them, âThis is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.â [30] So they said to him, âThen what sign do you do, that we may see and believe you? What work do you perform? [31] Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, âHe gave them bread from heaven to eat.ââ [32] Jesus then said to them, âTruly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven. [33] For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.â [34] They said to him, âSir, give us this bread always.â\n\n[35] Jesus said to them, âI am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst. [36] But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe. [37] All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out. [38] For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me. [39] And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day. [40] For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.â\n\n[41] So the Jews grumbled about him, because he said, âI am the bread that came down from heaven.â [42] They said, âIs not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, âI have come down from heavenâ?â [43] Jesus answered them, âDo not grumble among yourselves. [44] No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. [45] It is written in the Prophets, âAnd they will all be taught by God.â Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to meâ[46] not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father. [47] Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. [48] I am the bread of life. [49] Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. [50] This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die. [51] I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.â\n\n[52] The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, âHow can this man give us his flesh to eat?â [53] So Jesus said to them, âTruly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. [54] Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. [55] For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. [56] Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. [57] As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever feeds on me, he also will live because of me. [58] This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like the bread the fathers ate, and died. Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.â [59] Jesus said these things in the synagogue, as he taught at Capernaum.\n\n[60] When many of his disciples heard it, they said, âThis is a hard saying; who can listen to it?â [61] But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, âDo you take offense at this? [62] Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? [63] It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is no help at all. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. [64] But there are some of you who do not believe.â (For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.) [65] And he said, âThis is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.â\n\n[66] After this many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him. [67] So Jesus said to the twelve, âDo you want to go away as well?â [68] Simon Peter answered him, âLord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, [69] and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.â [70] Jesus answered them, âDid I not choose you, the twelve? And yet one of you is a devil.â [71] He spoke of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, was going to betray him."
    ,"[1] After this Jesus went about in Galilee. He would not go about in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him. [2] Now the Jews' Feast of Booths was at hand. [3] So his brothers said to him, âLeave here and go to Judea, that your disciples also may see the works you are doing. [4] For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.â [5] For not even his brothers believed in him. [6] Jesus said to them, âMy time has not yet come, but your time is always here. [7] The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it that its works are evil. [8] You go up to the feast. I am not going up to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come.â [9] After saying this, he remained in Galilee.\n\n[10] But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly but in private. [11] The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and saying, âWhere is he?â [12] And there was much muttering about him among the people. While some said, âHe is a good man,â others said, âNo, he is leading the people astray.â [13] Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him.\n\n[14] About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching. [15] The Jews therefore marveled, saying, âHow is it that this man has learning, when he has never studied?â [16] So Jesus answered them, âMy teaching is not mine, but his who sent me. [17] If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. [18] The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood. [19] Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?â [20] The crowd answered, âYou have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?â [21] Jesus answered them, âI did one work, and you all marvel at it. [22] Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath. [23] If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man's whole body well? [24] Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.â\n\n[25] Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, âIs not this the man whom they seek to kill? [26] And here he is, speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ? [27] But we know where this man comes from, and when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from.â [28] So Jesus proclaimed, as he taught in the temple, âYou know me, and you know where I come from. But I have not come of my own accord. He who sent me is true, and him you do not know. [29] I know him, for I come from him, and he sent me.â [30] So they were seeking to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come. [31] Yet many of the people believed in him. They said, âWhen the Christ appears, will he do more signs than this man has done?â\n\n[32] The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him. [33] Jesus then said, âI will be with you a little longer, and then I am going to him who sent me. [34] You will seek me and you will not find me. Where I am you cannot come.â [35] The Jews said to one another, âWhere does this man intend to go that we will not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? [36] What does he mean by saying, âYou will seek me and you will not find me,â and, âWhere I am you cannot comeâ?â\n\n[37] On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, âIf anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. [38] Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, âOut of his heart will flow rivers of living water.ââ [39] Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.\n\n[40] When they heard these words, some of the people said, âThis really is the Prophet.â [41] Others said, âThis is the Christ.â But some said, âIs the Christ to come from Galilee? [42] Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the offspring of David, and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David was?â [43] So there was a division among the people over him. [44] Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.\n\n[45] The officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, âWhy did you not bring him?â [46] The officers answered, âNo one ever spoke like this man!â [47] The Pharisees answered them, âHave you also been deceived? [48] Have any of the authorities or the Pharisees believed in him? [49] But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed.â [50] Nicodemus, who had gone to him before, and who was one of them, said to them, [51] âDoes our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does?â [52] They replied, âAre you from Galilee too? Search and see that no prophet arises from Galilee.â\n\n[The earliest manuscripts do not include 7:53â8:11.]\n\n[53] [[They went each to his own house, "
    ,"[1] but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. [2] Early in the morning he came again to the temple. All the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them. [3] The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placing her in the midst [4] they said to him, âTeacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. [5] Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?â [6] This they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. [7] And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, âLet him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.â [8] And once more he bent down and wrote on the ground. [9] But when they heard it, they went away one by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. [10] Jesus stood up and said to her, âWoman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?â [11] She said, âNo one, Lord.â And Jesus said, âNeither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.â]]\n\n[12] Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, âI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.â [13] So the Pharisees said to him, âYou are bearing witness about yourself; your testimony is not true.â [14] Jesus answered, âEven if I do bear witness about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going, but you do not know where I come from or where I am going. [15] You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one. [16] Yet even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for it is not I alone who judge, but I and the Father who sent me. [17] In your Law it is written that the testimony of two people is true. [18] I am the one who bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me.â [19] They said to him therefore, âWhere is your Father?â Jesus answered, âYou know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.â [20] These words he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.\n\n[21] So he said to them again, âI am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.â [22] So the Jews said, âWill he kill himself, since he says, âWhere I am going, you cannot comeâ?â [23] He said to them, âYou are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. [24] I told you that you would die in your sins, for unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins.â [25] So they said to him, âWho are you?â Jesus said to them, âJust what I have been telling you from the beginning. [26] I have much to say about you and much to judge, but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.â [27] They did not understand that he had been speaking to them about the Father. [28] So Jesus said to them, âWhen you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own authority, but speak just as the Father taught me. [29] And he who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him.â [30] As he was saying these things, many believed in him.\n\n[31] So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, âIf you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, [32] and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.â [33] They answered him, âWe are offspring of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone. How is it that you say, âYou will become freeâ?â\n\n[34] Jesus answered them, âTruly, truly, I say to you, everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin. [35] The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever. [36] So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. [37] I know that you are offspring of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me because my word finds no place in you. [38] I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.â\n\n[39] They answered him, âAbraham is our father.â Jesus said to them, âIf you were Abraham's children, you would be doing the works Abraham did, [40] but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did. [41] You are doing the works your father did.â They said to him, âWe were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Fatherâeven God.â [42] Jesus said to them, âIf God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me. [43] Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word. [44] You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies. [45] But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me. [46] Which one of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? [47] Whoever is of God hears the words of God. The reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God.â\n\n[48] The Jews answered him, âAre we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?â [49] Jesus answered, âI do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. [50] Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it, and he is the judge. [51] Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.â [52] The Jews said to him, âNow we know that you have a demon! Abraham died, as did the prophets, yet you say, âIf anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.â [53] Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died! Who do you make yourself out to be?â [54] Jesus answered, âIf I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, âHe is our God.â [55] But you have not known him. I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and I keep his word. [56] Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was glad.â [57] So the Jews said to him, âYou are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?â [58] Jesus said to them, âTruly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.â [59] So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple."
    ,"[1] As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth. [2] And his disciples asked him, âRabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?â [3] Jesus answered, âIt was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him. [4] We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work. [5] As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.â [6] Having said these things, he spit on the ground and made mud with the saliva. Then he anointed the man's eyes with the mud [7] and said to him, âGo, wash in the pool of Siloamâ (which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing.\n\n[8] The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar were saying, âIs this not the man who used to sit and beg?â [9] Some said, âIt is he.â Others said, âNo, but he is like him.â He kept saying, âI am the man.â [10] So they said to him, âThen how were your eyes opened?â [11] He answered, âThe man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and said to me, âGo to Siloam and wash.â So I went and washed and received my sight.â [12] They said to him, âWhere is he?â He said, âI do not know.â\n\n[13] They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind. [14] Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. [15] So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, âHe put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.â [16] Some of the Pharisees said, âThis man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.â But others said, âHow can a man who is a sinner do such signs?â And there was a division among them. [17] So they said again to the blind man, âWhat do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?â He said, âHe is a prophet.â\n\n[18] The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight [19] and asked them, âIs this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?â [20] His parents answered, âWe know that this is our son and that he was born blind. [21] But how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.â [22] (His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess Jesus to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.) [23] Therefore his parents said, âHe is of age; ask him.â\n\n[24] So for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, âGive glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.â [25] He answered, âWhether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.â [26] They said to him, âWhat did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?â [27] He answered them, âI have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?â [28] And they reviled him, saying, âYou are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. [29] We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.â [30] The man answered, âWhy, this is an amazing thing! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes. [31] We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him. [32] Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind. [33] If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.â [34] They answered him, âYou were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?â And they cast him out.\n\n[35] Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he said, âDo you believe in the Son of Man?â [36] He answered, âAnd who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?â [37] Jesus said to him, âYou have seen him, and it is he who is speaking to you.â [38] He said, âLord, I believe,â and he worshiped him. [39] Jesus said, âFor judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.â [40] Some of the Pharisees near him heard these things, and said to him, âAre we also blind?â [41] Jesus said to them, âIf you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, âWe see,â your guilt remains."
    ,"1] âTruly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber. [2] But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. [3] To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. [4] When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. [5] A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.â [6] This figure of speech Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.\n\n[7] So Jesus again said to them, âTruly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. [8] All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. [9] I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. [10] The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. [11] I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. [12] He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. [13] He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. [14] I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, [15] just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. [16] And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd. [17] For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again. [18] No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father.â\n\n[19] There was again a division among the Jews because of these words. [20] Many of them said, âHe has a demon, and is insane; why listen to him?â [21] Others said, âThese are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?â\n\n[22] At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. It was winter, [23] and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the colonnade of Solomon. [24] So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, âHow long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.â [25] Jesus answered them, âI told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name bear witness about me, [26] but you do not believe because you are not among my sheep. [27] My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. [28] I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. [29] My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand. [30] I and the Father are one.â\n\n[31] The Jews picked up stones again to stone him. [32] Jesus answered them, âI have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?â [33] The Jews answered him, âIt is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God.â [34] Jesus answered them, âIs it not written in your Law, âI said, you are godsâ? [35] If he called them gods to whom the word of God cameâand Scripture cannot be brokenâ[36] do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, âYou are blaspheming,â because I said, âI am the Son of Godâ? [37] If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me; [38] but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.â [39] Again they sought to arrest him, but he escaped from their hands.\n\n[40] He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and there he remained. [41] And many came to him. And they said, âJohn did no sign, but everything that John said about this man was true.â [42] And many believed in him there."
    ,"[1] Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. [2] It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill. [3] So the sisters sent to him, saying, âLord, he whom you love is ill.â [4] But when Jesus heard it he said, âThis illness does not lead to death. It is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.â\n\n[5] Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. [6] So, when he heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was. [7] Then after this he said to the disciples, âLet us go to Judea again.â [8] The disciples said to him, âRabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?â [9] Jesus answered, âAre there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. [10] But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.â [11] After saying these things, he said to them, âOur friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him.â [12] The disciples said to him, âLord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.â [13] Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep. [14] Then Jesus told them plainly, âLazarus has died, [15] and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.â [16] So Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, âLet us also go, that we may die with him.â\n\n[17] Now when Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days. [18] Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off, [19] and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother. [20] So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary remained seated in the house. [21] Martha said to Jesus, âLord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. [22] But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you.â [23] Jesus said to her, âYour brother will rise again.â [24] Martha said to him, âI know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.â [25] Jesus said to her, âI am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, [26] and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?â [27] She said to him, âYes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world.â\n\n[28] When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying in private, âThe Teacher is here and is calling for you.â [29] And when she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him. [30] Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him. [31] When the Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there. [32] Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, âLord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.â [33] When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled. [34] And he said, âWhere have you laid him?â They said to him, âLord, come and see.â [35] Jesus wept. [36] So the Jews said, âSee how he loved him!â [37] But some of them said, âCould not he who opened the eyes of the blind man also have kept this man from dying?â\n\n[38] Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. [39] Jesus said, âTake away the stone.â Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, âLord, by this time there will be an odor, for he has been dead four days.â [40] Jesus said to her, âDid I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?â [41] So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, âFather, I thank you that you have heard me. [42] I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that you sent me.â [43] When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, âLazarus, come out.â [44] The man who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, âUnbind him, and let him go.â\n\n[45] Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what he did, believed in him, [46] but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. [47] So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council and said, âWhat are we to do? For this man performs many signs. [48] If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.â [49] But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, âYou know nothing at all. [50] Nor do you understand that it is better for you that one man should die for the people, not that the whole nation should perish.â [51] He did not say this of his own accord, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, [52] and not for the nation only, but also to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad. [53] So from that day on they made plans to put him to death.\n\n[54] Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there to the region near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, and there he stayed with the disciples.\n\n[55] Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves. [56] They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, âWhat do you think? That he will not come to the feast at all?â [57] Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, he should let them know, so that they might arrest him."
    ,"[1] Six days before the Passover, Jesus therefore came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. [2] So they gave a dinner for him there. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those reclining with him at table. [3] Mary therefore took a pound of expensive ointment made from pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. [4] But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (he who was about to betray him), said, [5] âWhy was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?â [6] He said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having charge of the moneybag he used to help himself to what was put into it. [7] Jesus said, âLeave her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of my burial. [8] For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.â\n\n[9] When the large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, they came, not only on account of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. [10] So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well, [11] because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.\n\n[12] The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. [13] So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, âHosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!â [14] And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written,\n\n[15] âFear not, daughter of Zion;\nbehold, your king is coming,\nsitting on a donkey's colt!â\n\n[16] His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and had been done to him. [17] The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to bear witness. [18] The reason why the crowd went to meet him was that they heard he had done this sign. [19] So the Pharisees said to one another, âYou see that you are gaining nothing. Look, the world has gone after him.â\n\n[20] Now among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks. [21] So these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, âSir, we wish to see Jesus.â [22] Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. [23] And Jesus answered them, âThe hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. [24] Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. [25] Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. [26] If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there will my servant be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.\n\n[27] âNow is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? âFather, save me from this hourâ? But for this purpose I have come to this hour. [28] Father, glorify your name.â Then a voice came from heaven: âI have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.â [29] The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, âAn angel has spoken to him.â [30] Jesus answered, âThis voice has come for your sake, not mine. [31] Now is the judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be cast out. [32] And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.â [33] He said this to show by what kind of death he was going to die. [34] So the crowd answered him, âWe have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?â [35] So Jesus said to them, âThe light is among you for a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. [36] While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.â\n\nWhen Jesus had said these things, he departed and hid himself from them. [37] Though he had done so many signs before them, they still did not believe in him, [38] so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:\n\nâLord, who has believed what he heard from us,\nand to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?â\n\n[39] Therefore they could not believe. For again Isaiah said,\n\n[40] âHe has blinded their eyes\nand hardened their heart,\nlest they see with their eyes,\nand understand with their heart, and turn,\nand I would heal them.â\n\n[41] Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and spoke of him. [42] Nevertheless, many even of the authorities believed in him, but for fear of the Pharisees they did not confess it, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue; [43] for they loved the glory that comes from man more than the glory that comes from God.\n\n[44] And Jesus cried out and said, âWhoever believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me. [45] And whoever sees me sees him who sent me. [46] I have come into the world as light, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness. [47] If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world. [48] The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day. [49] For I have not spoken on my own authority, but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandmentâwhat to say and what to speak. [50] And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I say, therefore, I say as the Father has told me.â"
    ,"[1] Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. [2] During supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him, [3] Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God, [4] rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around his waist. [5] Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him. [6] He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, âLord, do you wash my feet?â [7] Jesus answered him, âWhat I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.â [8] Peter said to him, âYou shall never wash my feet.â Jesus answered him, âIf I do not wash you, you have no share with me.â [9] Simon Peter said to him, âLord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!â [10] Jesus said to him, âThe one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you.â [11] For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, âNot all of you are clean.â\n\n[12] When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, âDo you understand what I have done to you? [13] You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am. [14] If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. [15] For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you. [16] Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. [17] If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them. [18] I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But the Scripture will be fulfilled, âHe who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.â [19] I am telling you this now, before it takes place, that when it does take place you may believe that I am he. [20] Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever receives the one I send receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.â\n\n[21] After saying these things, Jesus was troubled in his spirit, and testified, âTruly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.â [22] The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke. [23] One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining at table at Jesus' side, [24] so Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking. [25] So that disciple, leaning back against Jesus, said to him, âLord, who is it?â [26] Jesus answered, âIt is he to whom I will give this morsel of bread when I have dipped it.â So when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. [27] Then after he had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, âWhat you are going to do, do quickly.â [28] Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him. [29] Some thought that, because Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him, âBuy what we need for the feast,â or that he should give something to the poor. [30] So, after receiving the morsel of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.\n\n[31] When he had gone out, Jesus said, âNow is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him. [32] If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once. [33] Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, âWhere I am going you cannot come.â [34] A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. [35] By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.â\n\n[36] Simon Peter said to him, âLord, where are you going?â Jesus answered him, âWhere I am going you cannot follow me now, but you will follow afterward.â [37] Peter said to him, âLord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.â [38] Jesus answered, âWill you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow till you have denied me three times."
    ,"[1] âLet not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. [2] In my Father's house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? [3] And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also. [4] And you know the way to where I am going.â [5] Thomas said to him, âLord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?â [6] Jesus said to him, âI am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. [7] If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him.â\n\n[8] Philip said to him, âLord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.â [9] Jesus said to him, âHave I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, âShow us the Fatherâ? [10] Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority, but the Father who dwells in me does his works. [11] Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else believe on account of the works themselves.\n\n[12] âTruly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father. [13] Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. [14] If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.\n\n[15] âIf you love me, you will keep my commandments. [16] And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, [17] even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you.\n\n[18] âI will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. [19] Yet a little while and the world will see me no more, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. [20] In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. [21] Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.â [22] Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, âLord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?â [23] Jesus answered him, âIf anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. [24] Whoever does not love me does not keep my words. And the word that you hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me.\n\n[25] âThese things I have spoken to you while I am still with you. [26] But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you. [27] Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid. [28] You heard me say to you, âI am going away, and I will come to you.â If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. [29] And now I have told you before it takes place, so that when it does take place you may believe. [30] I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no claim on me, [31] but I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. Rise, let us go from here."
    ,"[1] âI am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. [2] Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. [3] Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you. [4] Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. [5] I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. [6] If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. [7] If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. [8] By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples. [9] As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love. [10] If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. [11] These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.\n\n[12] âThis is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. [13] Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. [14] You are my friends if you do what I command you. [15] No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. [16] You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. [17] These things I command you, so that you will love one another.\n\n[18] âIf the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. [19] If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. [20] Remember the word that I said to you: âA servant is not greater than his master.â If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours. [21] But all these things they will do to you on account of my name, because they do not know him who sent me. [22] If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have been guilty of sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin. [23] Whoever hates me hates my Father also. [24] If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin, but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. [25] But the word that is written in their Law must be fulfilled: âThey hated me without a cause.â\n\n[26] âBut when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me. [27] And you also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning."
    ,"[1] âI have said all these things to you to keep you from falling away. [2] They will put you out of the synagogues. Indeed, the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God. [3] And they will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor me. [4] But I have said these things to you, that when their hour comes you may remember that I told them to you.\n\nâI did not say these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you. [5] But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, âWhere are you going?â [6] But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart. [7] Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. [8] And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment: [9] concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; [10] concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer; [11] concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.\n\n[12] âI still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. [13] When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. [14] He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. [15] All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.\n\n[16] âA little while, and you will see me no longer; and again a little while, and you will see me.â [17] So some of his disciples said to one another, âWhat is this that he says to us, âA little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while, and you will see meâ; and, âbecause I am going to the Fatherâ?â [18] So they were saying, âWhat does he mean by âa little whileâ? We do not know what he is talking about.â [19] Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him, so he said to them, âIs this what you are asking yourselves, what I meant by saying, âA little while and you will not see me, and again a little while and you will see meâ? [20] Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy. [21] When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow because her hour has come, but when she has delivered the baby, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into the world. [22] So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you. [23] In that day you will ask nothing of me. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you. [24] Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.\n\n[25] âI have said these things to you in figures of speech. The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech but will tell you plainly about the Father. [26] In that day you will ask in my name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf; [27] for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. [28] I came from the Father and have come into the world, and now I am leaving the world and going to the Father.â\n\n[29] His disciples said, âAh, now you are speaking plainly and not using figurative speech! [30] Now we know that you know all things and do not need anyone to question you; this is why we believe that you came from God.â [31] Jesus answered them, âDo you now believe? [32] Behold, the hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home, and will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me. [33] I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.â"
    ,"[1] When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, âFather, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you, [2] since you have given him authority over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. [3] And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. [4] I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do. [5] And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed.\n\n[6] âI have manifested your name to the people whom you gave me out of the world. Yours they were, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word. [7] Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you. [8] For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have come to know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me. [9] I am praying for them. I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours. [10] All mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them. [11] And I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are one. [12] While I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me. I have guarded them, and not one of them has been lost except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. [13] But now I am coming to you, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves. [14] I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. [15] I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one. [16] They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. [17] Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. [18] As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. [19] And for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.\n\n[20] âI do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word, [21] that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me. [22] The glory that you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one, [23] I in them and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me. [24] Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory that you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world. [25] O righteous Father, even though the world does not know you, I know you, and these know that you have sent me. [26] I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.â"
    ,"[1] When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples across the brook Kidron, where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered. [2] Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples. [3] So Judas, having procured a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, went there with lanterns and torches and weapons. [4] Then Jesus, knowing all that would happen to him, came forward and said to them, âWhom do you seek?â [5] They answered him, âJesus of Nazareth.â Jesus said to them, âI am he.â Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them. [6] When Jesus said to them, âI am he,â they drew back and fell to the ground. [7] So he asked them again, âWhom do you seek?â And they said, âJesus of Nazareth.â [8] Jesus answered, âI told you that I am he. So, if you seek me, let these men go.â [9] This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken: âOf those whom you gave me I have lost not one.â [10] Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.) [11] So Jesus said to Peter, âPut your sword into its sheath; shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?â\n\n[12] So the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him. [13] First they led him to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. [14] It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it would be expedient that one man should die for the people.\n\n[15] Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest, [16] but Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the servant girl who kept watch at the door, and brought Peter in. [17] The servant girl at the door said to Peter, âYou also are not one of this man's disciples, are you?â He said, âI am not.â [18] Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves. Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.\n\n[19] The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. [20] Jesus answered him, âI have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret. [21] Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them; they know what I said.â [22] When he had said these things, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, âIs that how you answer the high priest?â [23] Jesus answered him, âIf what I said is wrong, bear witness about the wrong; but if what I said is right, why do you strike me?â [24] Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.\n\n[25] Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, âYou also are not one of his disciples, are you?â He denied it and said, âI am not.â [26] One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, âDid I not see you in the garden with him?â [27] Peter again denied it, and at once a rooster crowed.\n\n[28] Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the governor's headquarters. It was early morning. They themselves did not enter the governor's headquarters, so that they would not be defiled, but could eat the Passover. [29] So Pilate went outside to them and said, âWhat accusation do you bring against this man?â [30] They answered him, âIf this man were not doing evil, we would not have delivered him over to you.â [31] Pilate said to them, âTake him yourselves and judge him by your own law.â The Jews said to him, âIt is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.â [32] This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to show by what kind of death he was going to die.\n\n[33] So Pilate entered his headquarters again and called Jesus and said to him, âAre you the King of the Jews?â [34] Jesus answered, âDo you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?â [35] Pilate answered, âAm I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you over to me. What have you done?â [36] Jesus answered, âMy kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.â [37] Then Pilate said to him, âSo you are a king?â Jesus answered, âYou say that I am a king. For this purpose I was born and for this purpose I have come into the worldâto bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.â [38] Pilate said to him, âWhat is truth?â\n\nAfter he had said this, he went back outside to the Jews and told them, âI find no guilt in him. [39] But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?â [40] They cried out again, âNot this man, but Barabbas!â Now Barabbas was a robber."
    ,"[1] Then Pilate took Jesus and flogged him. [2] And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head and arrayed him in a purple robe. [3] They came up to him, saying, âHail, King of the Jews!â and struck him with their hands. [4] Pilate went out again and said to them, âSee, I am bringing him out to you that you may know that I find no guilt in him.â [5] So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, âBehold the man!â [6] When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, âCrucify him, crucify him!â Pilate said to them, âTake him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no guilt in him.â [7] The Jews answered him, âWe have a law, and according to that law he ought to die because he has made himself the Son of God.â [8] When Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid. [9] He entered his headquarters again and said to Jesus, âWhere are you from?â But Jesus gave him no answer. [10] So Pilate said to him, âYou will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?â [11] Jesus answered him, âYou would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above. Therefore he who delivered me over to you has the greater sin.â\n\n[12] From then on Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, âIf you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend. Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.â [13] So when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Stone Pavement, and in Aramaic Gabbatha. [14] Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover. It was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, âBehold your King!â [15] They cried out, âAway with him, away with him, crucify him!â Pilate said to them, âShall I crucify your King?â The chief priests answered, âWe have no king but Caesar.â [16] So he delivered him over to them to be crucified.\n\nSo they took Jesus, [17] and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha. [18] There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them. [19] Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, âJesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.â [20] Many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek. [21] So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, âDo not write, âThe King of the Jews,â but rather, âThis man said, I am King of the Jews.ââ [22] Pilate answered, âWhat I have written I have written.â\n\n[23] When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom, [24] so they said to one another, âLet us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.â This was to fulfill the Scripture which says,\n\nâThey divided my garments among them,\nand for my clothing they cast lots.â\n\nSo the soldiers did these things, [25] but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. [26] When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, âWoman, behold, your son!â [27] Then he said to the disciple, âBehold, your mother!â And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.\n\n[28] After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfill the Scripture), âI thirst.â [29] A jar full of sour wine stood there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth. [30] When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, âIt is finished,â and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.\n\n[31] Since it was the day of Preparation, and so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away. [32] So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him. [33] But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. [34] But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. [35] He who saw it has borne witnessâhis testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truthâthat you also may believe. [36] For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled: âNot one of his bones will be broken.â [37] And again another Scripture says, âThey will look on him whom they have pierced.â\n\n[38] After these things Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body. [39] Nicodemus also, who earlier had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds in weight. [40] So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews. [41] Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. [42] So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there."
    ,"[1] Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. [2] So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, âThey have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.â [3] So Peter went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb. [4] Both of them were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. [5] And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. [6] Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying there, [7] and the face cloth, which had been on Jesus' head, not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself. [8] Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; [9] for as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead. [10] Then the disciples went back to their homes.\n\n[11] But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb. [12] And she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet. [13] They said to her, âWoman, why are you weeping?â She said to them, âThey have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.â [14] Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus. [15] Jesus said to her, âWoman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?â Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, âSir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.â [16] Jesus said to her, âMary.â She turned and said to him in Aramaic, âRabboni!â (which means Teacher). [17] Jesus said to her, âDo not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, âI am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.ââ [18] Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, âI have seen the Lordââand that he had said these things to her.\n\n[19] On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, âPeace be with you.â [20] When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. [21] Jesus said to them again, âPeace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you.â [22] And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, âReceive the Holy Spirit. [23] If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you withhold forgiveness from any, it is withheld.â\n\n[24] Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came. [25] So the other disciples told him, âWe have seen the Lord.â But he said to them, âUnless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe.â\n\n[26] Eight days later, his disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, âPeace be with you.â [27] Then he said to Thomas, âPut your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe.â [28] Thomas answered him, âMy Lord and my God!â [29] Jesus said to him, âHave you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.â\n\n[30] Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; [31] but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name."
    ,"[1] After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias, and he revealed himself in this way. [2] Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together. [3] Simon Peter said to them, âI am going fishing.â They said to him, âWe will go with you.â They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.\n\n[4] Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. [5] Jesus said to them, âChildren, do you have any fish?â They answered him, âNo.â [6] He said to them, âCast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.â So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, because of the quantity of fish. [7] That disciple whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter, âIt is the Lord!â When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment, for he was stripped for work, and threw himself into the sea. [8] The other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards off.\n\n[9] When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place, with fish laid out on it, and bread. [10] Jesus said to them, âBring some of the fish that you have just caught.â [11] So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, 153 of them. And although there were so many, the net was not torn. [12] Jesus said to them, âCome and have breakfast.â Now none of the disciples dared ask him, âWho are you?â They knew it was the Lord. [13] Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and so with the fish. [14] This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.\n\n[15] When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, âSimon, son of John, do you love me more than these?â He said to him, âYes, Lord; you know that I love you.â He said to him, âFeed my lambs.â [16] He said to him a second time, âSimon, son of John, do you love me?â He said to him, âYes, Lord; you know that I love you.â He said to him, âTend my sheep.â [17] He said to him the third time, âSimon, son of John, do you love me?â Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, âDo you love me?â and he said to him, âLord, you know everything; you know that I love you.â Jesus said to him, âFeed my sheep. [18] Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.â [19] (This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God.) And after saying this he said to him, âFollow me.â\n\n[20] Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who also had leaned back against him during the supper and had said, âLord, who is it that is going to betray you?â [21] When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, âLord, what about this man?â [22] Jesus said to him, âIf it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!â [23] So the saying spread abroad among the brothers that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, âIf it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?â\n\n[24] This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true.\n\n[25] Now there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written."

    ,"Acts":
    ["[1] In the first book, O Theophilus, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach, [2] until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen. [3] He presented himself alive to them after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.\n\n[4] And while staying with them he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, âyou heard from me; [5] for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.â\n\n[6] So when they had come together, they asked him, âLord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?â [7] He said to them, âIt is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority. [8] But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.â [9] And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. [10] And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes, [11] and said, âMen of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.â\n\n[12] Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away. [13] And when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James. [14] All these with one accord were devoting themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.\n\n[15] In those days Peter stood up among the brothers (the company of persons was in all about 120) and said, [16] âBrothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus. [17] For he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry.â [18] (Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness, and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out. [19] And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.) [20] âFor it is written in the Book of Psalms,\n\nââMay his camp become desolate,\nand let there be no one to dwell in itâ;\n\nand\n\nââLet another take his office.â\n\n[21] So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, [22] beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from usâone of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection.â [23] And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also called Justus, and Matthias. [24] And they prayed and said, âYou, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which one of these two you have chosen [25] to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.â [26] And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles."
    ,"[1] When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place. [2] And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. [3] And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them. [4] And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.\n\n[5] Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven. [6] And at this sound the multitude came together, and they were bewildered, because each one was hearing them speak in his own language. [7] And they were amazed and astonished, saying, âAre not all these who are speaking Galileans? [8] And how is it that we hear, each of us in his own native language? [9] Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, [10] Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, [11] both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabiansâwe hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God.â [12] And all were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, âWhat does this mean?â [13] But others mocking said, âThey are filled with new wine.â\n\n[14] But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them: âMen of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words. [15] For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day. [16] But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel:\n\n[17] ââAnd in the last days it shall be, God declares,\nthat I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh,\nand your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,\nand your young men shall see visions,\nand your old men shall dream dreams;\n[18] even on my male servants and female servants\nin those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.\n[19] And I will show wonders in the heavens above\nand signs on the earth below,\nblood, and fire, and vapor of smoke;\n[20] the sun shall be turned to darkness\nand the moon to blood,\nbefore the day of the Lord comes, the great and magnificent day.\n[21] And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.â\n\n[22] âMen of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves knowâ[23] this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. [24] God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. [25] For David says concerning him,\n\nââI saw the Lord always before me,\nfor he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken;\n[26] therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced;\nmy flesh also will dwell in hope.\n[27] For you will not abandon my soul to Hades,\nor let your Holy One see corruption.\n[28] You have made known to me the paths of life;\nyou will make me full of gladness with your presence.â\n\n[29] âBrothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. [30] Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, [31] he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. [32] This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. [33] Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. [34] For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says,\n\nââThe Lord said to my Lord,\nâSit at my right hand,\n[35] until I make your enemies your footstool.ââ\n\n[36] Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.â\n\n[37] Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, âBrothers, what shall we do?â [38] And Peter said to them, âRepent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. [39] For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.â [40] And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, âSave yourselves from this crooked generation.â [41] So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.\n\n[42] And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. [43] And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. [44] And all who believed were together and had all things in common. [45] And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. [46] And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, [47] praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved."
    ,"[1] Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. [2] And a man lame from birth was being carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple that is called the Beautiful Gate to ask alms of those entering the temple. [3] Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive alms. [4] And Peter directed his gaze at him, as did John, and said, âLook at us.â [5] And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them. [6] But Peter said, âI have no silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!â [7] And he took him by the right hand and raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. [8] And leaping up, he stood and began to walk, and entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. [9] And all the people saw him walking and praising God, [10] and recognized him as the one who sat at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, asking for alms. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.\n\n[11] While he clung to Peter and John, all the people, utterly astounded, ran together to them in the portico called Solomon's. [12] And when Peter saw it he addressed the people: âMen of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we have made him walk? [13] The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his servant Jesus, whom you delivered over and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him. [14] But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, [15] and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. [16] And his nameâby faith in his nameâhas made this man strong whom you see and know, and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all.\n\n[17] âAnd now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers. [18] But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he thus fulfilled. [19] Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out, [20] that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus, [21] whom heaven must receive until the time for restoring all the things about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets long ago. [22] Moses said, âThe Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you. [23] And it shall be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed from the people.â [24] And all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who came after him, also proclaimed these days. [25] You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, âAnd in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.â [26] God, having raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness.â"
    ,"[1] And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, [2] greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. [3] And they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening. [4] But many of those who had heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to about five thousand.\n\n[5] On the next day their rulers and elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem, [6] with Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family. [7] And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, âBy what power or by what name did you do this?â [8] Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, âRulers of the people and elders, [9] if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed, [10] let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the deadâby him this man is standing before you well. [11] This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone. [12] And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.â\n\n[13] Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they were astonished. And they recognized that they had been with Jesus. [14] But seeing the man who was healed standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition. [15] But when they had commanded them to leave the council, they conferred with one another, [16] saying, âWhat shall we do with these men? For that a notable sign has been performed through them is evident to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it. [17] But in order that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name.â [18] So they called them and charged them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. [19] But Peter and John answered them, âWhether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge, [20] for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard.â [21] And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people, for all were praising God for what had happened. [22] For the man on whom this sign of healing was performed was more than forty years old.\n\n[23] When they were released, they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them. [24] And when they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said, âSovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them, [25] who through the mouth of our father David, your servant, said by the Holy Spirit,\n\nââWhy did the Gentiles rage,\nand the peoples plot in vain?\n[26] The kings of the earth set themselves,\nand the rulers were gathered together,\nagainst the Lord and against his Anointedââ\n\n[27] for truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, [28] to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place. [29] And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness, [30] while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus.â [31] And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness.\n\n[32] Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common. [33] And with great power the apostles were giving their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. [34] There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold [35] and laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need. [36] Thus Joseph, who was also called by the apostles Barnabas (which means son of encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus, [37] sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet."
    ,"[1] But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property, [2] and with his wife's knowledge he kept back for himself some of the proceeds and brought only a part of it and laid it at the apostles' feet. [3] But Peter said, âAnanias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land? [4] While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to man but to God.â [5] When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and breathed his last. And great fear came upon all who heard of it. [6] The young men rose and wrapped him up and carried him out and buried him.\n\n[7] After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. [8] And Peter said to her, âTell me whether you sold the land for so much.â And she said, âYes, for so much.â [9] But Peter said to her, âHow is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.â [10] Immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. When the young men came in they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. [11] And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard of these things.\n\n[12] Now many signs and wonders were regularly done among the people by the hands of the apostles. And they were all together in Solomon's Portico. [13] None of the rest dared join them, but the people held them in high esteem. [14] And more than ever believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women, [15] so that they even carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on cots and mats, that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them. [16] The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed.\n\n[17] But the high priest rose up, and all who were with him (that is, the party of the Sadducees), and filled with jealousy [18] they arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison. [19] But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said, [20] âGo and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life.â [21] And when they heard this, they entered the temple at daybreak and began to teach.\n\nNow when the high priest came, and those who were with him, they called together the council, all the senate of the people of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought. [22] But when the officers came, they did not find them in the prison, so they returned and reported, [23] âWe found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them we found no one inside.â [24] Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were greatly perplexed about them, wondering what this would come to. [25] And someone came and told them, âLook! The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.â [26] Then the captain with the officers went and brought them, but not by force, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.\n\n[27] And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest questioned them, [28] saying, âWe strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man's blood upon us.â [29] But Peter and the apostles answered, âWe must obey God rather than men. [30] The God of our fathers raised Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree. [31] God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. [32] And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.â\n\n[33] When they heard this, they were enraged and wanted to kill them. [34] But a Pharisee in the council named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in honor by all the people, stood up and gave orders to put the men outside for a little while. [35] And he said to them, âMen of Israel, take care what you are about to do with these men. [36] For before these days Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing. [37] After him Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away some of the people after him. He too perished, and all who followed him were scattered. [38] So in the present case I tell you, keep away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or this undertaking is of man, it will fail; [39] but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You might even be found opposing God!â So they took his advice, [40] and when they had called in the apostles, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. [41] Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name. [42] And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and preaching that the Christ is Jesus."
    ,"[1] Now in these days when the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint by the Hellenists arose against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution. [2] And the twelve summoned the full number of the disciples and said, âIt is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables. [3] Therefore, brothers, pick out from among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint to this duty. [4] But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.â [5] And what they said pleased the whole gathering, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch. [6] These they set before the apostles, and they prayed and laid their hands on them.\n\n[7] And the word of God continued to increase, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith.\n\n[8] And Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people. [9] Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and disputed with Stephen. [10] But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking. [11] Then they secretly instigated men who said, âWe have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.â [12] And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council, [13] and they set up false witnesses who said, âThis man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law, [14] for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses delivered to us.â [15] And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel."
    ,"[1] And the high priest said, âAre these things so?â [2] And Stephen said:\n\nâBrothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, [3] and said to him, âGo out from your land and from your kindred and go into the land that I will show you.â [4] Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living. [5] Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot's length, but promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child. [6] And God spoke to this effectâthat his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and afflict them four hundred years. [7] âBut I will judge the nation that they serve,â said God, âand after that they shall come out and worship me in this place.â [8] And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.\n\n[9] âAnd the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt; but God was with him [10] and rescued him out of all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him ruler over Egypt and over all his household. [11] Now there came a famine throughout all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers could find no food. [12] But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers on their first visit. [13] And on the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family became known to Pharaoh. [14] And Joseph sent and summoned Jacob his father and all his kindred, seventy-five persons in all. [15] And Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died, he and our fathers, [16] and they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.\n\n[17] âBut as the time of the promise drew near, which God had granted to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt [18] until there arose over Egypt another king who did not know Joseph. [19] He dealt shrewdly with our race and forced our fathers to expose their infants, so that they would not be kept alive. [20] At this time Moses was born; and he was beautiful in God's sight. And he was brought up for three months in his father's house, [21] and when he was exposed, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son. [22] And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and deeds.\n\n[23] âWhen he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of Israel. [24] And seeing one of them being wronged, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian. [25] He supposed that his brothers would understand that God was giving them salvation by his hand, but they did not understand. [26] And on the following day he appeared to them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them, saying, âMen, you are brothers. Why do you wrong each other?â [27] But the man who was wronging his neighbor thrust him aside, saying, âWho made you a ruler and a judge over us? [28] Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?â [29] At this retort Moses fled and became an exile in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.\n\n[30] âNow when forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush. [31] When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight, and as he drew near to look, there came the voice of the Lord: [32] âI am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.â And Moses trembled and did not dare to look. [33] Then the Lord said to him, âTake off the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground. [34] I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.â\n\n[35] âThis Moses, whom they rejected, saying, âWho made you a ruler and a judge?ââthis man God sent as both ruler and redeemer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush. [36] This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years. [37] This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, âGod will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers.â [38] This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our fathers. He received living oracles to give to us. [39] Our fathers refused to obey him, but thrust him aside, and in their hearts they turned to Egypt, [40] saying to Aaron, âMake for us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses who led us out from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.â [41] And they made a calf in those days, and offered a sacrifice to the idol and were rejoicing in the works of their hands. [42] But God turned away and gave them over to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets:\n\nââDid you bring to me slain beasts and sacrifices,\nduring the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?\n[43] You took up the tent of Moloch\nand the star of your god Rephan,\nthe images that you made to worship;\nand I will send you into exile beyond Babylon.â\n\n[44] âOur fathers had the tent of witness in the wilderness, just as he who spoke to Moses directed him to make it, according to the pattern that he had seen. [45] Our fathers in turn brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our fathers. So it was until the days of David, [46] who found favor in the sight of God and asked to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob. [47] But it was Solomon who built a house for him. [48] Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made by hands, as the prophet says,\n\n[49] ââHeaven is my throne,\nand the earth is my footstool.\nWhat kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord,\nor what is the place of my rest?\n[50] Did not my hand make all these things?â\n\n[51] âYou stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you. [52] Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered, [53] you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it.â\n\n[54] Now when they heard these things they were enraged, and they ground their teeth at him. [55] But he, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. [56] And he said, âBehold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.â [57] But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and rushed together at him. [58] Then they cast him out of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul. [59] And as they were stoning Stephen, he called out, âLord Jesus, receive my spirit.â [60] And falling to his knees he cried out with a loud voice, âLord, do not hold this sin against them.â And when he had said this, he fell asleep."
    ,"[1] And Saul approved of his execution.\n\nAnd there arose on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. [2] Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him. [3] But Saul was ravaging the church, and entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and committed them to prison.\n\n[4] Now those who were scattered went about preaching the word. [5] Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ. [6] And the crowds with one accord paid attention to what was being said by Philip, when they heard him and saw the signs that he did. [7] For unclean spirits, crying out with a loud voice, came out of many who had them, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed. [8] So there was much joy in that city.\n\n[9] But there was a man named Simon, who had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was somebody great. [10] They all paid attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, âThis man is the power of God that is called Great.â [11] And they paid attention to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic. [12] But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. [13] Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was amazed.\n\n[14] Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John, [15] who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, [16] for he had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. [17] Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit. [18] Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money, [19] saying, âGive me this power also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.â [20] But Peter said to him, âMay your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money! [21] You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God. [22] Repent, therefore, of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you. [23] For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.â [24] And Simon answered, âPray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.â\n\n[25] Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.\n\n[26] Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, âRise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.â This is a desert place. [27] And he rose and went. And there was an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship [28] and was returning, seated in his chariot, and he was reading the prophet Isaiah. [29] And the Spirit said to Philip, âGo over and join this chariot.â [30] So Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked, âDo you understand what you are reading?â [31] And he said, âHow can I, unless someone guides me?â And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. [32] Now the passage of the Scripture that he was reading was this:\n\nâLike a sheep he was led to the slaughter\nand like a lamb before its shearer is silent,\nso he opens not his mouth.\n[33] In his humiliation justice was denied him.\nWho can describe his generation?\nFor his life is taken away from the earth.â\n\n[34] And the eunuch said to Philip, âAbout whom, I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?â [35] Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this Scripture he told him the good news about Jesus. [36] And as they were going along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, âSee, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized?â [38] And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him. [39] And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing. [40] But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he preached the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea."
    ,"[1] But Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest [2] and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. [3] Now as he went on his way, he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven shone around him. [4] And falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, âSaul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?â [5] And he said, âWho are you, Lord?â And he said, âI am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. [6] But rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.â [7] The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one. [8] Saul rose from the ground, and although his eyes were opened, he saw nothing. So they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. [9] And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.\n\n[10] Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, âAnanias.â And he said, âHere I am, Lord.â [11] And the Lord said to him, âRise and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul, for behold, he is praying, [12] and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.â [13] But Ananias answered, âLord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem. [14] And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.â [15] But the Lord said to him, âGo, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel. [16] For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.â [17] So Ananias departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, âBrother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.â [18] And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized; [19] and taking food, he was strengthened.\n\nFor some days he was with the disciples at Damascus. [20] And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, saying, âHe is the Son of God.â [21] And all who heard him were amazed and said, âIs not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called upon this name? And has he not come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests?â [22] But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ.\n\n[23] When many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him, [24] but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night in order to kill him, [25] but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.\n\n[26] And when he had come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join the disciples. And they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple. [27] But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who spoke to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus. [28] So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem, preaching boldly in the name of the Lord. [29] And he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists. But they were seeking to kill him. [30] And when the brothers learned this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.\n\n[31] So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was being built up. And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it multiplied.\n\n[32] Now as Peter went here and there among them all, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda. [33] There he found a man named Aeneas, bedridden for eight years, who was paralyzed. [34] And Peter said to him, âAeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; rise and make your bed.â And immediately he rose. [35] And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.\n\n[36] Now there was in Joppa a disciple named Tabitha, which, translated, means Dorcas. She was full of good works and acts of charity. [37] In those days she became ill and died, and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room. [38] Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, urging him, âPlease come to us without delay.â [39] So Peter rose and went with them. And when he arrived, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him weeping and showing tunics and other garments that Dorcas made while she was with them. [40] But Peter put them all outside, and knelt down and prayed; and turning to the body he said, âTabitha, arise.â And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up. [41] And he gave her his hand and raised her up. Then, calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive. [42] And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. [43] And he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon, a tanner."
    ,"[1] At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort, [2] a devout man who feared God with all his household, gave alms generously to the people, and prayed continually to God. [3] About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God come in and say to him, âCornelius.â [4] And he stared at him in terror and said, âWhat is it, Lord?â And he said to him, âYour prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God. [5] And now send men to Joppa and bring one Simon who is called Peter. [6] He is lodging with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.â [7] When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who attended him, [8] and having related everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.\n\n[9] The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray. [10] And he became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance [11] and saw the heavens opened and something like a great sheet descending, being let down by its four corners upon the earth. [12] In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air. [13] And there came a voice to him: âRise, Peter; kill and eat.â [14] But Peter said, âBy no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.â [15] And the voice came to him again a second time, âWhat God has made clean, do not call common.â [16] This happened three times, and the thing was taken up at once to heaven.\n\n[17] Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the vision that he had seen might mean, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood at the gate [18] and called out to ask whether Simon who was called Peter was lodging there. [19] And while Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, âBehold, three men are looking for you. [20] Rise and go down and accompany them without hesitation, for I have sent them.â [21] And Peter went down to the men and said, âI am the one you are looking for. What is the reason for your coming?â [22] And they said, âCornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say.â [23] So he invited them in to be his guests.\n\nThe next day he rose and went away with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him. [24] And on the following day they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. [25] When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him. [26] But Peter lifted him up, saying, âStand up; I too am a man.â [27] And as he talked with him, he went in and found many persons gathered. [28] And he said to them, âYou yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit anyone of another nation, but God has shown me that I should not call any person common or unclean. [29] So when I was sent for, I came without objection. I ask then why you sent for me.â\n\n[30] And Cornelius said, âFour days ago, about this hour, I was praying in my house at the ninth hour, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing [31] and said, âCornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God. [32] Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.â [33] So I sent for you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here in the presence of God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.â\n\n[34] So Peter opened his mouth and said: âTruly I understand that God shows no partiality, [35] but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. [36] As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all), [37] you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed: [38] how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. [39] And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree, [40] but God raised him on the third day and made him to appear, [41] not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. [42] And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. [43] To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.â\n\n[44] While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word. [45] And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles. [46] For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared, [47] âCan anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?â [48] And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days."
    ,"[1] Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. [2] So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party criticized him, saying, [3] âYou went to uncircumcised men and ate with them.â [4] But Peter began and explained it to them in order: [5] âI was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to me. [6] Looking at it closely, I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air. [7] And I heard a voice saying to me, âRise, Peter; kill and eat.â [8] But I said, âBy no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.â [9] But the voice answered a second time from heaven, âWhat God has made clean, do not call common.â [10] This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven. [11] And behold, at that very moment three men arrived at the house in which we were, sent to me from Caesarea. [12] And the Spirit told me to go with them, making no distinction. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man's house. [13] And he told us how he had seen the angel stand in his house and say, âSend to Joppa and bring Simon who is called Peter; [14] he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household.â [15] As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning. [16] And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, âJohn baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.â [17] If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God's way?â [18] When they heard these things they fell silent. And they glorified God, saying, âThen to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life.â\n\n[19] Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews. [20] But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists also, preaching the Lord Jesus. [21] And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord. [22] The report of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. [23] When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose, [24] for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord. [25] So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, [26] and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people. And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians.\n\n[27] Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. [28] And one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world (this took place in the days of Claudius). [29] So the disciples determined, every one according to his ability, to send relief to the brothers living in Judea. [30] And they did so, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul."
    ,"[1] About that time Herod the king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church. [2] He killed James the brother of John with the sword, [3] and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread. [4] And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people. [5] So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church.\n\n[6] Now when Herod was about to bring him out, on that very night, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison. [7] And behold, an angel of the Lord stood next to him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, âGet up quickly.â And the chains fell off his hands. [8] And the angel said to him, âDress yourself and put on your sandals.â And he did so. And he said to him, âWrap your cloak around you and follow me.â [9] And he went out and followed him. He did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. [10] When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened for them of its own accord, and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel left him. [11] When Peter came to himself, he said, âNow I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.â\n\n[12] When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying. [13] And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer. [14] Recognizing Peter's voice, in her joy she did not open the gate but ran in and reported that Peter was standing at the gate. [15] They said to her, âYou are out of your mind.â But she kept insisting that it was so, and they kept saying, âIt is his angel!â [16] But Peter continued knocking, and when they opened, they saw him and were amazed. [17] But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, âTell these things to James and to the brothers.â Then he departed and went to another place.\n\n[18] Now when day came, there was no little disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter. [19] And after Herod searched for him and did not find him, he examined the sentries and ordered that they should be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and spent time there.\n\n[20] Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon, and they came to him with one accord, and having persuaded Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's country for food. [21] On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat upon the throne, and delivered an oration to them. [22] And the people were shouting, âThe voice of a god, and not of a man!â [23] Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him down, because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and breathed his last.\n\n[24] But the word of God increased and multiplied.\n\n[25] And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had completed their service, bringing with them John, whose other name was Mark."
    ,"[1] Now there were in the church at Antioch prophets and teachers, Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a lifelong friend of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. [2] While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, âSet apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.â [3] Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off.\n\n[4] So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus. [5] When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John to assist them. [6] When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus. [7] He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. [8] But Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith. [9] But Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him [10] and said, âYou son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord? [11] And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and unable to see the sun for a time.â Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand. [12] Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord.\n\n[13] Now Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. And John left them and returned to Jerusalem, [14] but they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down. [15] After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent a message to them, saying, âBrothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, say it.â [16] So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said:\n\nâMen of Israel and you who fear God, listen. [17] The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it. [18] And for about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness. [19] And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance. [20] All this took about 450 years. And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. [21] Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. [22] And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, of whom he testified and said, âI have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will.â [23] Of this man's offspring God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised. [24] Before his coming, John had proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. [25] And as John was finishing his course, he said, âWhat do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but behold, after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.â\n\n[26] âBrothers, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation. [27] For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets, which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him. [28] And though they found in him no guilt worthy of death, they asked Pilate to have him executed. [29] And when they had carried out all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb. [30] But God raised him from the dead, [31] and for many days he appeared to those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people. [32] And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers, [33] this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus, as also it is written in the second Psalm,\n\nââYou are my Son,\ntoday I have begotten you.â\n\n[34] And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way,\n\nââI will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.â\n\n[35] Therefore he says also in another psalm,\n\nââYou will not let your Holy One see corruption.â\n\n[36] For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw corruption, [37] but he whom God raised up did not see corruption. [38] Let it be known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, [39] and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses. [40] Beware, therefore, lest what is said in the Prophets should come about:\n\n[41] ââLook, you scoffers,\nbe astounded and perish;\nfor I am doing a work in your days,\na work that you will not believe, even if one tells it to you.ââ\n\n[42] As they went out, the people begged that these things might be told them the next Sabbath. [43] And after the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who, as they spoke with them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.\n\n[44] The next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord. [45] But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to contradict what was spoken by Paul, reviling him. [46] And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, âIt was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you. Since you thrust it aside and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles. [47] For so the Lord has commanded us, saying,\n\nââI have made you a light for the Gentiles,\nthat you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.ââ\n\n[48] And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed. [49] And the word of the Lord was spreading throughout the whole region. [50] But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district. [51] But they shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium. [52] And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit."
    ,"[1] Now at Iconium they entered together into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed. [2] But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers. [3] So they remained for a long time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands. [4] But the people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews and some with the apostles. [5] When an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to mistreat them and to stone them, [6] they learned of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding country, [7] and there they continued to preach the gospel.\n\n[8] Now at Lystra there was a man sitting who could not use his feet. He was crippled from birth and had never walked. [9] He listened to Paul speaking. And Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well, [10] said in a loud voice, âStand upright on your feet.â And he sprang up and began walking. [11] And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lycaonian, âThe gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!â [12] Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker. [13] And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was at the entrance to the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds. [14] But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their garments and rushed out into the crowd, crying out, [15] âMen, why are you doing these things? We also are men, of like nature with you, and we bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them. [16] In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways. [17] Yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.â [18] Even with these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.\n\n[19] But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead. [20] But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city, and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe. [21] When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch, [22] strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God. [23] And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.\n\n[24] Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia. [25] And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia, [26] and from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had fulfilled. [27] And when they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. [28] And they remained no little time with the disciples."
    ,"[1] But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, âUnless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.â [2] And after Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question. [3] So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and brought great joy to all the brothers. [4] When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared all that God had done with them. [5] But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees rose up and said, âIt is necessary to circumcise them and to order them to keep the law of Moses.â\n\n[6] The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter. [7] And after there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, âBrothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. [8] And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us, [9] and he made no distinction between us and them, having cleansed their hearts by faith. [10] Now, therefore, why are you putting God to the test by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? [11] But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.â\n\n[12] And all the assembly fell silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles. [13] After they finished speaking, James replied, âBrothers, listen to me. [14] Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles, to take from them a people for his name. [15] And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written,\n\n[16] ââAfter this I will return,\nand I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen;\nI will rebuild its ruins,\nand I will restore it,\n[17] that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord,\nand all the Gentiles who are called by my name,\nsays the Lord, who makes these things [18] known from of old.â\n\n[19] Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God, [20] but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood. [21] For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him, for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues.â\n\n[22] Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers, [23] with the following letter: âThe brothers, both the apostles and the elders, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greetings. [24] Since we have heard that some persons have gone out from us and troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions, [25] it has seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, [26] men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. [27] We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth. [28] For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements: [29] that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.â\n\n[30] So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch, and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter. [31] And when they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement. [32] And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words. [33] And after they had spent some time, they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them. [35] But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.\n\n[36] And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, âLet us return and visit the brothers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.â [37] Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark. [38] But Paul thought best not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work. [39] And there arose a sharp disagreement, so that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus, [40] but Paul chose Silas and departed, having been commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord. [41] And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches."
    ,"[1] Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek. [2] He was well spoken of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium. [3] Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. [4] As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decisions that had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem. [5] So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and they increased in numbers daily.\n\n[6] And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia. [7] And when they had come up to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them. [8] So, passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas. [9] And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing there, urging him and saying, âCome over to Macedonia and help us.â [10] And when Paul had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.\n\n[11] So, setting sail from Troas, we made a direct voyage to Samothrace, and the following day to Neapolis, [12] and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We remained in this city some days. [13] And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together. [14] One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple goods, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul. [15] And after she was baptized, and her household as well, she urged us, saying, âIf you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay.â And she prevailed upon us.\n\n[16] As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by fortune-telling. [17] She followed Paul and us, crying out, âThese men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation.â [18] And this she kept doing for many days. Paul, having become greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, âI command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.â And it came out that very hour.\n\n[19] But when her owners saw that their hope of gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers. [20] And when they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, âThese men are Jews, and they are disturbing our city. [21] They advocate customs that are not lawful for us as Romans to accept or practice.â [22] The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods. [23] And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them safely. [24] Having received this order, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.\n\n[25] About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them, [26] and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's bonds were unfastened. [27] When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. [28] But Paul cried with a loud voice, âDo not harm yourself, for we are all here.â [29] And the jailer called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas. [30] Then he brought them out and said, âSirs, what must I do to be saved?â [31] And they said, âBelieve in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.â [32] And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. [33] And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their wounds; and he was baptized at once, he and all his family. [34] Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them. And he rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God.\n\n[35] But when it was day, the magistrates sent the police, saying, âLet those men go.â [36] And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, âThe magistrates have sent to let you go. Therefore come out now and go in peace.â [37] But Paul said to them, âThey have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now throw us out secretly? No! Let them come themselves and take us out.â [38] The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens. [39] So they came and apologized to them. And they took them out and asked them to leave the city. [40] So they went out of the prison and visited Lydia. And when they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them and departed."
    ,"[1] Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. [2] And Paul went in, as was his custom, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, [3] explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying, âThis Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ.â [4] And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a great many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women. [5] But the Jews were jealous, and taking some wicked men of the rabble, they formed a mob, set the city in an uproar, and attacked the house of Jason, seeking to bring them out to the crowd. [6] And when they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city authorities, shouting, âThese men who have turned the world upside down have come here also, [7] and Jason has received them, and they are all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.â [8] And the people and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard these things. [9] And when they had taken money as security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.\n\n[10] The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived they went into the Jewish synagogue. [11] Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so. [12] Many of them therefore believed, with not a few Greek women of high standing as well as men. [13] But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Berea also, they came there too, agitating and stirring up the crowds. [14] Then the brothers immediately sent Paul off on his way to the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained there. [15] Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens, and after receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.\n\n[16] Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols. [17] So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there. [18] Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also conversed with him. And some said, âWhat does this babbler wish to say?â Others said, âHe seems to be a preacher of foreign divinitiesââbecause he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection. [19] And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, âMay we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? [20] For you bring some strange things to our ears. We wish to know therefore what these things mean.â [21] Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there would spend their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new.\n\n[22] So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: âMen of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious. [23] For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: âTo the unknown god.â What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you. [24] The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man, [25] nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything. [26] And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place, [27] that they should seek God, and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us, [28] for\n\nââIn him we live and move and have our beingâ;\n\nas even some of your own poets have said,\n\nââFor we are indeed his offspring.â\n\n[29] Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man. [30] The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent, [31] because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.â\n\n[32] Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked. But others said, âWe will hear you again about this.â [33] So Paul went out from their midst. [34] But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them."
    ,"[1] After this Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. [2] And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. And he went to see them, [3] and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them and worked, for they were tentmakers by trade. [4] And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and tried to persuade Jews and Greeks.\n\n[5] When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul was occupied with the word, testifying to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus. [6] And when they opposed and reviled him, he shook out his garments and said to them, âYour blood be on your own heads! I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.â [7] And he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God. His house was next door to the synagogue. [8] Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with his entire household. And many of the Corinthians hearing Paul believed and were baptized. [9] And the Lord said to Paul one night in a vision, âDo not be afraid, but go on speaking and do not be silent, [10] for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many in this city who are my people.â [11] And he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.\n\n[12] But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack on Paul and brought him before the tribunal, [13] saying, âThis man is persuading people to worship God contrary to the law.â [14] But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, âIf it were a matter of wrongdoing or vicious crime, O Jews, I would have reason to accept your complaint. [15] But since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of these things.â [16] And he drove them from the tribunal. [17] And they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the tribunal. But Gallio paid no attention to any of this.\n\n[18] After this, Paul stayed many days longer and then took leave of the brothers and set sail for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila. At Cenchreae he had cut his hair, for he was under a vow. [19] And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there, but he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. [20] When they asked him to stay for a longer period, he declined. [21] But on taking leave of them he said, âI will return to you if God wills,â and he set sail from Ephesus.\n\n[22] When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and then went down to Antioch. [23] After spending some time there, he departed and went from one place to the next through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.\n\n[24] Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, competent in the Scriptures. [25] He had been instructed in the way of the Lord. And being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John. [26] He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately. [27] And when he wished to cross to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he arrived, he greatly helped those who through grace had believed, [28] for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, showing by the Scriptures that the Christ was Jesus."
    ,"[1] And it happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples. [2] And he said to them, âDid you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?â And they said, âNo, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.â [3] And he said, âInto what then were you baptized?â They said, âInto John's baptism.â [4] And Paul said, âJohn baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus.â [5] On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. [6] And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying. [7] There were about twelve men in all.\n\n[8] And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God. [9] But when some became stubborn and continued in unbelief, speaking evil of the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them and took the disciples with him, reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus. [10] This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.\n\n[11] And God was doing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul, [12] so that even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were carried away to the sick, and their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them. [13] Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, âI adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims.â [14] Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this. [15] But the evil spirit answered them, âJesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?â [16] And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. [17] And this became known to all the residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. And fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled. [18] Also many of those who were now believers came, confessing and divulging their practices. [19] And a number of those who had practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. And they counted the value of them and found it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver. [20] So the word of the Lord continued to increase and prevail mightily.\n\n[21] Now after these events Paul resolved in the Spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem, saying, âAfter I have been there, I must also see Rome.â [22] And having sent into Macedonia two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.\n\n[23] About that time there arose no little disturbance concerning the Way. [24] For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen. [25] These he gathered together, with the workmen in similar trades, and said, âMen, you know that from this business we have our wealth. [26] And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great many people, saying that gods made with hands are not gods. [27] And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be counted as nothing, and that she may even be deposed from her magnificence, she whom all Asia and the world worship.â\n\n[28] When they heard this they were enraged and were crying out, âGreat is Artemis of the Ephesians!â [29] So the city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed together into the theater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were Paul's companions in travel. [30] But when Paul wished to go in among the crowd, the disciples would not let him. [31] And even some of the Asiarchs, who were friends of his, sent to him and were urging him not to venture into the theater. [32] Now some cried out one thing, some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together. [33] Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom the Jews had put forward. And Alexander, motioning with his hand, wanted to make a defense to the crowd. [34] But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours they all cried out with one voice, âGreat is Artemis of the Ephesians!â\n\n[35] And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, âMen of Ephesus, who is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis, and of the sacred stone that fell from the sky? [36] Seeing then that these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash. [37] For you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious nor blasphemers of our goddess. [38] If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another. [39] But if you seek anything further, it shall be settled in the regular assembly. [40] For we really are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no cause that we can give to justify this commotion.â [41] And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly."
    ,"[1] After the uproar ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and after encouraging them, he said farewell and departed for Macedonia. [2] When he had gone through those regions and had given them much encouragement, he came to Greece. [3] There he spent three months, and when a plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia. [4] Sopater the Berean, son of Pyrrhus, accompanied him; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and the Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus. [5] These went on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas, [6] but we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days we came to them at Troas, where we stayed for seven days.\n\n[7] On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and he prolonged his speech until midnight. [8] There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered. [9] And a young man named Eutychus, sitting at the window, sank into a deep sleep as Paul talked still longer. And being overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead. [10] But Paul went down and bent over him, and taking him in his arms, said, âDo not be alarmed, for his life is in him.â [11] And when Paul had gone up and had broken bread and eaten, he conversed with them a long while, until daybreak, and so departed. [12] And they took the youth away alive, and were not a little comforted.\n\n[13] But going ahead to the ship, we set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for so he had arranged, intending himself to go by land. [14] And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and went to Mitylene. [15] And sailing from there we came the following day opposite Chios; the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after that we went to Miletus. [16] For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not have to spend time in Asia, for he was hastening to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.\n\n[17] Now from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church to come to him. [18] And when they came to him, he said to them:\n\nâYou yourselves know how I lived among you the whole time from the first day that I set foot in Asia, [19] serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that happened to me through the plots of the Jews; [20] how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house, [21] testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. [22] And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, constrained by the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there, [23] except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me. [24] But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God. [25] And now, behold, I know that none of you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom will see my face again. [26] Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all, [27] for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God. [28] Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood. [29] I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock; [30] and from among your own selves will arise men speaking twisted things, to draw away the disciples after them. [31] Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish every one with tears. [32] And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified. [33] I coveted no one's silver or gold or apparel. [34] You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me. [35] In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, âIt is more blessed to give than to receive.ââ\n\n[36] And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all. [37] And there was much weeping on the part of all; they embraced Paul and kissed him, [38] being sorrowful most of all because of the word he had spoken, that they would not see his face again. And they accompanied him to the ship."
    ,"[1] And when we had parted from them and set sail, we came by a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara. [2] And having found a ship crossing to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail. [3] When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left we sailed to Syria and landed at Tyre, for there the ship was to unload its cargo. [4] And having sought out the disciples, we stayed there for seven days. And through the Spirit they were telling Paul not to go on to Jerusalem. [5] When our days there were ended, we departed and went on our journey, and they all, with wives and children, accompanied us until we were outside the city. And kneeling down on the beach, we prayed [6] and said farewell to one another. Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home.\n\n[7] When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, and we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for one day. [8] On the next day we departed and came to Caesarea, and we entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him. [9] He had four unmarried daughters, who prophesied. [10] While we were staying for many days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. [11] And coming to us, he took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands and said, âThus says the Holy Spirit, âThis is how the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.ââ [12] When we heard this, we and the people there urged him not to go up to Jerusalem. [13] Then Paul answered, âWhat are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.â [14] And since he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, âLet the will of the Lord be done.â\n\n[15] After these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem. [16] And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.\n\n[17] When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly. [18] On the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present. [19] After greeting them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. [20] And when they heard it, they glorified God. And they said to him, âYou see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed. They are all zealous for the law, [21] and they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or walk according to our customs. [22] What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come. [23] Do therefore what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow; [24] take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself also live in observance of the law. [25] But as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality.â [26] Then Paul took the men, and the next day he purified himself along with them and went into the temple, giving notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and the offering presented for each one of them.\n\n[27] When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him, [28] crying out, âMen of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place. Moreover, he even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.â [29] For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple. [30] Then all the city was stirred up, and the people ran together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once the gates were shut. [31] And as they were seeking to kill him, word came to the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion. [32] He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. And when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. [33] Then the tribune came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He inquired who he was and what he had done. [34] Some in the crowd were shouting one thing, some another. And as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks. [35] And when he came to the steps, he was actually carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd, [36] for the mob of the people followed, crying out, âAway with him!â\n\n[37] As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the tribune, âMay I say something to you?â And he said, âDo you know Greek? [38] Are you not the Egyptian, then, who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?â [39] Paul replied, âI am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no obscure city. I beg you, permit me to speak to the people.â [40] And when he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the steps, motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great hush, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying:"
    ,"[1] âBrothers and fathers, hear the defense that I now make before you.â\n\n[2] And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew language, they became even more quiet. And he said:\n\n[3] âI am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God as all of you are this day. [4] I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women, [5] as the high priest and the whole council of elders can bear me witness. From them I received letters to the brothers, and I journeyed toward Damascus to take those also who were there and bring them in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished.\n\n[6] âAs I was on my way and drew near to Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone around me. [7] And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, âSaul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?â [8] And I answered, âWho are you, Lord?â And he said to me, âI am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.â [9] Now those who were with me saw the light but did not understand the voice of the one who was speaking to me. [10] And I said, âWhat shall I do, Lord?â And the Lord said to me, âRise, and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all that is appointed for you to do.â [11] And since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus.\n\n[12] âAnd one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there, [13] came to me, and standing by me said to me, âBrother Saul, receive your sight.â And at that very hour I received my sight and saw him. [14] And he said, âThe God of our fathers appointed you to know his will, to see the Righteous One and to hear a voice from his mouth; [15] for you will be a witness for him to everyone of what you have seen and heard. [16] And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name.â\n\n[17] âWhen I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance [18] and saw him saying to me, âMake haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.â [19] And I said, âLord, they themselves know that in one synagogue after another I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you. [20] And when the blood of Stephen your witness was being shed, I myself was standing by and approving and watching over the garments of those who killed him.â [21] And he said to me, âGo, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.ââ\n\n[22] Up to this word they listened to him. Then they raised their voices and said, âAway with such a fellow from the earth! For he should not be allowed to live.â [23] And as they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air, [24] the tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, saying that he should be examined by flogging, to find out why they were shouting against him like this. [25] But when they had stretched him out for the whips, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, âIs it lawful for you to flog a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned?â [26] When the centurion heard this, he went to the tribune and said to him, âWhat are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.â [27] So the tribune came and said to him, âTell me, are you a Roman citizen?â And he said, âYes.â [28] The tribune answered, âI bought this citizenship for a large sum.â Paul said, âBut I am a citizen by birth.â [29] So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him immediately, and the tribune also was afraid, for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him.\n\n[30] But on the next day, desiring to know the real reason why he was being accused by the Jews, he unbound him and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and he brought Paul down and set him before them."
    ,"[1] And looking intently at the council, Paul said, âBrothers, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day.â [2] And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth. [3] Then Paul said to him, âGod is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?â [4] Those who stood by said, âWould you revile God's high priest?â [5] And Paul said, âI did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest, for it is written, âYou shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.ââ\n\n[6] Now when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, âBrothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. It is with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial.â [7] And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. [8] For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all. [9] Then a great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and contended sharply, âWe find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit or an angel spoke to him?â [10] And when the dissension became violent, the tribune, afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him away from among them by force and bring him into the barracks.\n\n[11] The following night the Lord stood by him and said, âTake courage, for as you have testified to the facts about me in Jerusalem, so you must testify also in Rome.â\n\n[12] When it was day, the Jews made a plot and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. [13] There were more than forty who made this conspiracy. [14] They went to the chief priests and elders and said, âWe have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food till we have killed Paul. [15] Now therefore you, along with the council, give notice to the tribune to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case more exactly. And we are ready to kill him before he comes near.â\n\n[16] Now the son of Paul's sister heard of their ambush, so he went and entered the barracks and told Paul. [17] Paul called one of the centurions and said, âTake this young man to the tribune, for he has something to tell him.â [18] So he took him and brought him to the tribune and said, âPaul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to say to you.â [19] The tribune took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, âWhat is it that you have to tell me?â [20] And he said, âThe Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more closely about him. [21] But do not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him, who have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him. And now they are ready, waiting for your consent.â [22] So the tribune dismissed the young man, charging him, âTell no one that you have informed me of these things.â\n\n[23] Then he called two of the centurions and said, âGet ready two hundred soldiers, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go as far as Caesarea at the third hour of the night. [24] Also provide mounts for Paul to ride and bring him safely to Felix the governor.â [25] And he wrote a letter to this effect:\n\n[26] âClaudius Lysias, to his Excellency the governor Felix, greetings. [27] This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen. [28] And desiring to know the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their council. [29] I found that he was being accused about questions of their law, but charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment. [30] And when it was disclosed to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him.â\n\n[31] So the soldiers, according to their instructions, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris. [32] And on the next day they returned to the barracks, letting the horsemen go on with him. [33] When they had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him. [34] On reading the letter, he asked what province he was from. And when he learned that he was from Cilicia, [35] he said, âI will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive.â And he commanded him to be guarded in Herod's praetorium."
    ,"[1] And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a spokesman, one Tertullus. They laid before the governor their case against Paul. [2] And when he had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying:\n\nâSince through you we enjoy much peace, and since by your foresight, most excellent Felix, reforms are being made for this nation, [3] in every way and everywhere we accept this with all gratitude. [4] But, to detain you no further, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly. [5] For we have found this man a plague, one who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the world and is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. [6] He even tried to profane the temple, but we seized him. [8] By examining him yourself you will be able to find out from him about everything of which we accuse him.â\n\n[9] The Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that all these things were so.\n\n[10] And when the governor had nodded to him to speak, Paul replied:\n\nâKnowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defense. [11] You can verify that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem, [12] and they did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues or in the city. [13] Neither can they prove to you what they now bring up against me. [14] But this I confess to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets, [15] having a hope in God, which these men themselves accept, that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the unjust. [16] So I always take pains to have a clear conscience toward both God and man. [17] Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings. [18] While I was doing this, they found me purified in the temple, without any crowd or tumult. But some Jews from Asiaâ[19] they ought to be here before you and to make an accusation, should they have anything against me. [20] Or else let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the council, [21] other than this one thing that I cried out while standing among them: âIt is with respect to the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you this day.ââ\n\n[22] But Felix, having a rather accurate knowledge of the Way, put them off, saying, âWhen Lysias the tribune comes down, I will decide your case.â [23] Then he gave orders to the centurion that he should be kept in custody but have some liberty, and that none of his friends should be prevented from attending to his needs.\n\n[24] After some days Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus. [25] And as he reasoned about righteousness and self-control and the coming judgment, Felix was alarmed and said, âGo away for the present. When I get an opportunity I will summon you.â [26] At the same time he hoped that money would be given him by Paul. So he sent for him often and conversed with him. [27] When two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. And desiring to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison."
    ,"[1] Now three days after Festus had arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. [2] And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews laid out their case against Paul, and they urged him, [3] asking as a favor against Paul that he summon him to Jerusalemâbecause they were planning an ambush to kill him on the way. [4] Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea and that he himself intended to go there shortly. [5] âSo,â said he, âlet the men of authority among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them bring charges against him.â\n\n[6] After he stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought. [7] When he had arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges against him that they could not prove. [8] Paul argued in his defense, âNeither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I committed any offense.â [9] But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, âDo you wish to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried on these charges before me?â [10] But Paul said, âI am standing before Caesar's tribunal, where I ought to be tried. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you yourself know very well. [11] If then I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything for which I deserve to die, I do not seek to escape death. But if there is nothing to their charges against me, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar.â [12] Then Festus, when he had conferred with his council, answered, âTo Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go.â\n\n[13] Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus. [14] And as they stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, âThere is a man left prisoner by Felix, [15] and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid out their case against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him. [16] I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up anyone before the accused met the accusers face to face and had opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against him. [17] So when they came together here, I made no delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought. [18] When the accusers stood up, they brought no charge in his case of such evils as I supposed. [19] Rather they had certain points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who was dead, but whom Paul asserted to be alive. [20] Being at a loss how to investigate these questions, I asked whether he wanted to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding them. [21] But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the emperor, I ordered him to be held until I could send him to Caesar.â [22] Then Agrippa said to Festus, âI would like to hear the man myself.â âTomorrow,â said he, âyou will hear him.â\n\n[23] So on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city. Then, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in. [24] And Festus said, âKing Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer. [25] But I found that he had done nothing deserving death. And as he himself appealed to the emperor, I decided to go ahead and send him. [26] But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him. Therefore I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that, after we have examined him, I may have something to write. [27] For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to indicate the charges against him.â"
    ,"[1] So Agrippa said to Paul, âYou have permission to speak for yourself.â Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense:\n\n[2] âI consider myself fortunate that it is before you, King Agrippa, I am going to make my defense today against all the accusations of the Jews, [3] especially because you are familiar with all the customs and controversies of the Jews. Therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.\n\n[4] âMy manner of life from my youth, spent from the beginning among my own nation and in Jerusalem, is known by all the Jews. [5] They have known for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that according to the strictest party of our religion I have lived as a Pharisee. [6] And now I stand here on trial because of my hope in the promise made by God to our fathers, [7] to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly worship night and day. And for this hope I am accused by Jews, O king! [8] Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?\n\n[9] âI myself was convinced that I ought to do many things in opposing the name of Jesus of Nazareth. [10] And I did so in Jerusalem. I not only locked up many of the saints in prison after receiving authority from the chief priests, but when they were put to death I cast my vote against them. [11] And I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to make them blaspheme, and in raging fury against them I persecuted them even to foreign cities.\n\n[12] âIn this connection I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests. [13] At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, that shone around me and those who journeyed with me. [14] And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, âSaul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.â [15] And I said, âWho are you, Lord?â And the Lord said, âI am Jesus whom you are persecuting. [16] But rise and stand upon your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a servant and witness to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you, [17] delivering you from your people and from the Gentilesâto whom I am sending you [18] to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.â\n\n[19] âTherefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, [20] but declared first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout all the region of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds in keeping with their repentance. [21] For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me. [22] To this day I have had the help that comes from God, and so I stand here testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would come to pass: [23] that the Christ must suffer and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles.â\n\n[24] And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, âPaul, you are out of your mind; your great learning is driving you out of your mind.â [25] But Paul said, âI am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking true and rational words. [26] For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak boldly. For I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this has not been done in a corner. [27] King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.â [28] And Agrippa said to Paul, âIn a short time would you persuade me to be a Christian?â [29] And Paul said, âWhether short or long, I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I amâexcept for these chains.â\n\n[30] Then the king rose, and the governor and Bernice and those who were sitting with them. [31] And when they had withdrawn, they said to one another, âThis man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment.â [32] And Agrippa said to Festus, âThis man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.â"
    ,"[1] And when it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan Cohort named Julius. [2] And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia, we put to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica. [3] The next day we put in at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul kindly and gave him leave to go to his friends and be cared for. [4] And putting out to sea from there we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us. [5] And when we had sailed across the open sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia. [6] There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy and put us on board. [7] We sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, and as the wind did not allow us to go farther, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone. [8] Coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.\n\n[9] Since much time had passed, and the voyage was now dangerous because even the Fast was already over, Paul advised them, [10] saying, âSirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.â [11] But the centurion paid more attention to the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said. [12] And because the harbor was not suitable to spend the winter in, the majority decided to put out to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing both southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there.\n\n[13] Now when the south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to the shore. [14] But soon a tempestuous wind, called the northeaster, struck down from the land. [15] And when the ship was caught and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along. [16] Running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we managed with difficulty to secure the ship's boat. [17] After hoisting it up, they used supports to undergird the ship. Then, fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and thus they were driven along. [18] Since we were violently storm-tossed, they began the next day to jettison the cargo. [19] And on the third day they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands. [20] When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.\n\n[21] Since they had been without food for a long time, Paul stood up among them and said, âMen, you should have listened to me and not have set sail from Crete and incurred this injury and loss. [22] Yet now I urge you to take heart, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. [23] For this very night there stood before me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship, [24] and he said, âDo not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. And behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.â [25] So take heart, men, for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told. [26] But we must run aground on some island.â\n\n[27] When the fourteenth night had come, as we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors suspected that they were nearing land. [28] So they took a sounding and found twenty fathoms. A little farther on they took a sounding again and found fifteen fathoms. [29] And fearing that we might run on the rocks, they let down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come. [30] And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, and had lowered the ship's boat into the sea under pretense of laying out anchors from the bow, [31] Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, âUnless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.â [32] Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship's boat and let it go.\n\n[33] As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, âToday is the fourteenth day that you have continued in suspense and without food, having taken nothing. [34] Therefore I urge you to take some food. For it will give you strength, for not a hair is to perish from the head of any of you.â [35] And when he had said these things, he took bread, and giving thanks to God in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat. [36] Then they all were encouraged and ate some food themselves. [37] (We were in all 276 persons in the ship.) [38] And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.\n\n[39] Now when it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, on which they planned if possible to run the ship ashore. [40] So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes that tied the rudders. Then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach. [41] But striking a reef, they ran the vessel aground. The bow stuck and remained immovable, and the stern was being broken up by the surf. [42] The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any should swim away and escape. [43] But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for the land, [44] and the rest on planks or on pieces of the ship. And so it was that all were brought safely to land."
    ,"[1] After we were brought safely through, we then learned that the island was called Malta. [2] The native people showed us unusual kindness, for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all, because it had begun to rain and was cold. [3] When Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand. [4] When the native people saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, âNo doubt this man is a murderer. Though he has escaped from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.â [5] He, however, shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm. [6] They were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But when they had waited a long time and saw no misfortune come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.\n\n[7] Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us and entertained us hospitably for three days. [8] It happened that the father of Publius lay sick with fever and dysentery. And Paul visited him and prayed, and putting his hands on him, healed him. [9] And when this had taken place, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured. [10] They also honored us greatly, and when we were about to sail, they put on board whatever we needed.\n\n[11] After three months we set sail in a ship that had wintered in the island, a ship of Alexandria, with the twin gods as a figurehead. [12] Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days. [13] And from there we made a circuit and arrived at Rhegium. And after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli. [14] There we found brothers and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome. [15] And the brothers there, when they heard about us, came as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. On seeing them, Paul thanked God and took courage. [16] And when we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier who guarded him.\n\n[17] After three days he called together the local leaders of the Jews, and when they had gathered, he said to them, âBrothers, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. [18] When they had examined me, they wished to set me at liberty, because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case. [19] But because the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesarâthough I had no charge to bring against my nation. [20] For this reason, therefore, I have asked to see you and speak with you, since it is because of the hope of Israel that I am wearing this chain.â [21] And they said to him, âWe have received no letters from Judea about you, and none of the brothers coming here has reported or spoken any evil about you. [22] But we desire to hear from you what your views are, for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against.â\n\n[23] When they had appointed a day for him, they came to him at his lodging in greater numbers. From morning till evening he expounded to them, testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets. [24] And some were convinced by what he said, but others disbelieved. [25] And disagreeing among themselves, they departed after Paul had made one statement: âThe Holy Spirit was right in saying to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet:\n\n[26] ââGo to this people, and say,\nâYou will indeed hear but never understand,\nand you will indeed see but never perceive.â\n[27] For this people's heart has grown dull,\nand with their ears they can barely hear,\nand their eyes they have closed;\nlest they should see with their eyes\nand hear with their ears\nand understand with their heart\nand turn, and I would heal them.â\n\n[28] Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen.â\n\n[30] He lived there two whole years at his own expense, and welcomed all who came to him, [31] proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance."
