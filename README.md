# Walk Through The Bible
This is an app that allows you to view Biblical locations on a map as you read the text. The opening view is a list of books to choose from, and selecting a book directs you to a view that allows you to swipe through each chapter of that book and plot Biblical locations on the map as you go. This is in the early development stage as it only includes the book of Matthew thus far.

##Getting Started
You will need to have cocoapods installed in order for the app to run properly. In your terminal, submit this line:

    sudo gem install cocoapods
    
Also, this project is written in Swift 3.0, so you'll need to have XCode 8 or convert the code to an earlier version of Swift.

If the above conditions are satistifed, clone or download the project to run it in the simulator or on your device.
