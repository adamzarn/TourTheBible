Hello and thank you for downloading Tour the Bible. The development of this resource was borne out of a trip I took to Israel with Moody Bible Institute. When we visited various sites and opened the Scriptures, I wished I had had this app. If you’ll be touring Israel soon or if you’re just a devoted student of the Word, now you can easily discover where the events of God’s plan took place and gain a better understanding of the Bible than you’ve ever had before. Please feel free to email me with any questions, bug fix requests, or suggestions.

In Him,
Adam Zarn
