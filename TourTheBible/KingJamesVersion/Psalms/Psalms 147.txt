Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely. 147:2 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel. 147:3 He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds. 147:4 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names. 147:5 Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite. 147:6 The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground. 147:7 Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God: 147:8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains. 147:9 He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry. 147:10 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man. 147:11 The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy. 147:12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion. 147:13 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee. 147:14 He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat. 147:15 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly. 147:16 He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes. 147:17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold? 147:18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow. 147:19 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. 147:20 He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.
