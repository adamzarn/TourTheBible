I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. 121:2 My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth. 121:3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber. 121:4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. 121:5 The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand. 121:6 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. 121:7 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. 121:8 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.
