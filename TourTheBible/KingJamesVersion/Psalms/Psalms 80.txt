Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth. 80:2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us. 80:3 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. 80:4 O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? 80:5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure. 80:6 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves. 80:7 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. 80:8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. 80:9 Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land. 80:10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars. 80:11 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river. 80:12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her? 80:13 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it. 80:14 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine; 80:15 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself. 80:16 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. 80:17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself. 80:18 So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name. 80:19 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
