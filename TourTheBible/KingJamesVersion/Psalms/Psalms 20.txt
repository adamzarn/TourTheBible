The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee; 20:2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion; 20:3 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah. 20:4 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel. 20:5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions. 20:6 Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand. 20:7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God. 20:8 They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright. 20:9 Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.
