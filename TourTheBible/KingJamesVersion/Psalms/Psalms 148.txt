Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise him in the heights. 148:2 Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts. 148:3 Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light. 148:4 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens. 148:5 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created. 148:6 He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass. 148:7 Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps: 148:8 Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word: 148:9 Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars: 148:10 Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl: 148:11 Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth: 148:12 Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children: 148:13 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven. 148:14 He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD.
