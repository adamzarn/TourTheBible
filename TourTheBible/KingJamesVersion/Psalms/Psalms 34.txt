I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth. 34:2 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad. 34:3 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together. 34:4 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears. 34:5 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed. 34:6 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. 34:7 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. 34:8 O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him. 34:9 O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him. 34:10 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing. 34:11 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD. 34:12 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good? 34:13 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. 34:14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. 34:15 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry. 34:16 The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. 34:17 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles. 34:18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit. 34:19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all. 34:20 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken. 34:21 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate. 34:22 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.
