The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof. 97:2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne. 97:3 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about. 97:4 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled. 97:5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 97:6 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory. 97:7 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods. 97:8 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD. 97:9 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods. 97:10 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. 97:11 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. 97:12 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.
