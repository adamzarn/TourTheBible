God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah. 67:2 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations. 67:3 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. 67:4 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah. 67:5 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. 67:6 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us. 67:7 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
