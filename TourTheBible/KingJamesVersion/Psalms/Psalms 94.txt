O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself. 94:2 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud. 94:3 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph? 94:4 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves? 94:5 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage. 94:6 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. 94:7 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it. 94:8 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise? 94:9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see? 94:10 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know? 94:11 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity. 94:12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law; 94:13 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked. 94:14 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance. 94:15 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it. 94:16 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? 94:17 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence. 94:18 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up. 94:19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul. 94:20 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law? 94:21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. 94:22 But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge. 94:23 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off.
