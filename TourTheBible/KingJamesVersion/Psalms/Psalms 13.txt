How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? 13:2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me? 13:3 Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death; 13:4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved. 13:5 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. 13:6 I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
