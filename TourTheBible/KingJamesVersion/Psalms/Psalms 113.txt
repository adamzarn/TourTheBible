Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD. 113:2 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. 113:3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD's name is to be praised. 113:4 The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens. 113:5 Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high, 113:6 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth! 113:7 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill; 113:8 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people. 113:9 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.
