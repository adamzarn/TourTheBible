I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me. 77:2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted. 77:3 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah. 77:4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. 77:5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. 77:6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search. 77:7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? 77:8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore? 77:9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah. 77:10 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High. 77:11 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old. 77:12 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings. 77:13 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God? 77:14 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people. 77:15 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. 77:16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled. 77:17 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad. 77:18 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook. 77:19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known. 77:20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
