Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me. 59:2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men. 59:3 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD. 59:4 They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold. 59:5 Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah. 59:6 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. 59:7 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear? 59:8 But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision. 59:9 Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defence. 59:10 The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies. 59:11 Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield. 59:12 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak. 59:13 Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah. 59:14 And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. 59:15 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied. 59:16 But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble. 59:17 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.
