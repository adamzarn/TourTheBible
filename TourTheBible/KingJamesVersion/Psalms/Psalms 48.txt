Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness. 48:2 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King. 48:3 God is known in her palaces for a refuge. 48:4 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together. 48:5 They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away. 48:6 Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail. 48:7 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind. 48:8 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah. 48:9 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple. 48:10 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness. 48:11 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments. 48:12 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof. 48:13 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following. 48:14 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.
