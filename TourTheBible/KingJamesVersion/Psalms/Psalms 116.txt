I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications. 116:2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. 116:3 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. 116:4 Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. 116:5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful. 116:6 The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me. 116:7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee. 116:8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. 116:9 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living. 116:10 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted: 116:11 I said in my haste, All men are liars. 116:12 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me? 116:13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD. 116:14 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people. 116:15 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints. 116:16 O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds. 116:17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD. 116:18 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people. 116:19 In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
