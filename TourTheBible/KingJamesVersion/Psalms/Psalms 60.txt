O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again. 60:2 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh. 60:3 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment. 60:4 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah. 60:5 That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me. 60:6 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 60:7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver; 60:8 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me. 60:9 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? 60:10 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies? 60:11 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. 60:12 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
