Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world: 49:2 Both low and high, rich and poor, together. 49:3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. 49:4 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp. 49:5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about? 49:6 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; 49:7 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: 49:8 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:) 49:9 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption. 49:10 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others. 49:11 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names. 49:12 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish. 49:13 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah. 49:14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling. 49:15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah. 49:16 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased; 49:17 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him. 49:18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself. 49:19 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light. 49:20 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.
