Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee. 102:2 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily. 102:3 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth. 102:4 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread. 102:5 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin. 102:6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert. 102:7 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top. 102:8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me. 102:9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping. 102:10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down. 102:11 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass. 102:12 But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations. 102:13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come. 102:14 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof. 102:15 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory. 102:16 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory. 102:17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer. 102:18 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD. 102:19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth; 102:20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death; 102:21 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem; 102:22 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD. 102:23 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days. 102:24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations. 102:25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands. 102:26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: 102:27 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end. 102:28 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.
