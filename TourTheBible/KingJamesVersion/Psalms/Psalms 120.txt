In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me. 120:2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue. 120:3 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue? 120:4 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper. 120:5 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar! 120:6 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace. 120:7 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.
