Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright. 33:2 Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings. 33:3 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise. 33:4 For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth. 33:5 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD. 33:6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. 33:7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses. 33:8 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. 33:9 For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast. 33:10 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect. 33:11 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations. 33:12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance. 33:13 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men. 33:14 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth. 33:15 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works. 33:16 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. 33:17 An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength. 33:18 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy; 33:19 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. 33:20 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield. 33:21 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. 33:22 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.
