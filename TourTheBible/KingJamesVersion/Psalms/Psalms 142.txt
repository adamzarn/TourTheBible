I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication. 142:2 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble. 142:3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me. 142:4 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. 142:5 I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living. 142:6 Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. 142:7 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
