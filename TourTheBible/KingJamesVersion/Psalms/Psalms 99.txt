The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved. 99:2 The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people. 99:3 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy. 99:4 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. 99:5 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy. 99:6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them. 99:7 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them. 99:8 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions. 99:9 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.
