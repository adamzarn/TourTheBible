Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 29:2 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. 29:3 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters. 29:4 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty. 29:5 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon. 29:6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn. 29:7 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire. 29:8 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. 29:9 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory. 29:10 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever. 29:11 The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.
