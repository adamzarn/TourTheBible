O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. 108:2 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early. 108:3 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. 108:4 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds. 108:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth; 108:6 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me. 108:7 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 108:8 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver; 108:9 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph. 108:10 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? 108:11 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts? 108:12 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. 108:13 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
