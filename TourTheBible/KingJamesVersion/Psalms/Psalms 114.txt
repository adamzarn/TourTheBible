When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; 114:2 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion. 114:3 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back. 114:4 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs. 114:5 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back? 114:6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs? 114:7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; 114:8 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
