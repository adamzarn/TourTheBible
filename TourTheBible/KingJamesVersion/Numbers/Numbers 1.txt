1:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, 1:2 Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their polls; 1:3 From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies. 1:4 And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of his fathers. 1:5 And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you: of the tribe of Reuben; Elizur the son of Shedeur. 1:6 Of Simeon; Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. 1:7 Of Judah; Nahshon the son of Amminadab. 1:8 Of Issachar; Nethaneel the son of Zuar. 1:9 Of Zebulun; Eliab the son of Helon. 1:10 Of the children of Joseph: of Ephraim;

and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle. 1:51 And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 1:52 And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts. 1:53 But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony. 1:54 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.
