Then Job answered and said, 16:2 I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all. 16:3 Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?  16:4 I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you. 16:5 But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief. 16:6 Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?  16:7 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company. 16:8 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face. 16:9 He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me. 16:10 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me. 16:11 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked. 16:12 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark. 16:13 His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground. 16:14 He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant. 16:15 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust. 16:16 My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death; 16:17 Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure. 16:18 O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place. 16:19 Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high. 16:20 My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God. 16:21 O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!  16:22 When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
