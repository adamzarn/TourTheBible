Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?  39:2 Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?  39:3 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows. 39:4 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them. 39:5 Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?  39:6 Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings. 39:7 He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver. 39:8 The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing. 39:9 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib? 39:10 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?  39:11 Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?  39:12 Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?  39:13 Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?  39:14 Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust, 39:15 And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them. 39:16 She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not her's: her labour is in vain without fear; 39:17 Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding. 39:18 What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider. 39:19 Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?  39:20 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible. 39:21 He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men. 39:22 He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword. 39:23 The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield. 39:24 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet. 39:25 He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 39:26 Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?  39:27 Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?  39:28 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place. 39:29 From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off. 39:30 Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.
