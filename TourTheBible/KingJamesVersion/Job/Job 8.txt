Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 8:2 How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?  8:3 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?  8:4 If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression; 8:5 If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; 8:6 If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. 8:7 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase. 8:8 For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers: 8:9 (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:) 8:10 Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?  8:11 Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?  8:12 Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb. 8:13 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish: 8:14 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web. 8:15 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure. 8:16 He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden. 8:17 His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones. 8:18 If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee. 8:19 Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow. 8:20 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers: 8:21 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing. 8:22 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
