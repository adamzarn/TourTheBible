"Behold, my eye has seen all this. My ear has heard and understood it. 13:2 What you know, I know also. I am not inferior to you. 13:3 "Surely I would speak to the Almighty. I desire to reason with God. 13:4 But you are forgers of lies. You are all physicians of no value. 13:5 Oh that you would be completely silent! Then you would be wise. 13:6 Hear now my reasoning. Listen to the pleadings of my lips. 13:7 Will you speak unrighteously for God, and talk deceitfully for him? 13:8 Will you show partiality to him? Will you contend for God? 13:9 Is it good that he should search you out? Or as one deceives a man, will you deceive him? 13:10 He will surely reprove you if you secretly show partiality. 13:11 Shall not his majesty make you afraid, And his dread fall on you? 13:12 Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defenses are defenses of clay. 13:13 "Be silent, leave me alone, that I may speak. Let come on me what will. 13:14 Why should I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand? 13:15 Behold, he will kill me. I have no hope. Nevertheless, I will maintain my ways before him. 13:16 This also shall be my salvation, that a godless man shall not come before him. 13:17 Hear diligently my speech. Let my declaration be in your ears. 13:18 See now, I have set my cause in order. I know that I am righteous. 13:19 Who is he who will contend with me? For then would I hold my peace and give up the spirit. 13:20 "Only don't do two things to me; then I will not hide myself from your face: 13:21 withdraw your hand far from me; and don't let your terror make me afraid. 13:22 Then call, and I will answer; or let me speak, and you answer me. 13:23 How many are my iniquities and sins? Make me know my disobedience and my sin. 13:24 Why hide you your face, and hold me for your enemy? 13:25 Will you harass a driven leaf? Will you pursue the dry stubble? 13:26 For you write bitter things against me, and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth: 13:27 You also put my feet in the stocks, and mark all my paths. You set a bound to the soles of my feet, 13:28 though I am decaying like a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten.
