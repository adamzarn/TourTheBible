"Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold which they refine. 28:2 Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted out of the ore. 28:3 Man sets an end to darkness, and searches out, to the furthest bound, the stones of obscurity and of thick darkness. 28:4 He breaks open a shaft away from where people live. They are forgotten by the foot. They hang far from men, they swing back and forth. 28:5 As for the earth, out of it comes bread; Underneath it is turned up as it were by fire. 28:6 Sapphires come from its rocks. It has dust of gold. 28:7 That path no bird of prey knows, neither has the falcon's eye seen it. 28:8 The proud animals have not trodden it, nor has the fierce lion passed by there. 28:9 He puts forth his hand on the flinty rock, and he overturns the mountains by the roots. 28:10 He cuts out channels among the rocks. His eye sees every precious thing. 28:11 He binds the streams that they don't trickle. The thing that is hidden he brings forth to light. 28:12 "But where shall wisdom be found? Where is the place of understanding? 28:13 Man doesn't know its price; Neither is it found in the land of the living. 28:14 The deep says, 'It isn't in me.' The sea says, 'It isn't with me.' 28:15 It can't be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for its price. 28:16 It can't be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. 28:17 Gold and glass can't equal it, neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold. 28:18 No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal. Yes, the price of wisdom is above rubies. 28:19 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, Neither shall it be valued with pure gold. 28:20 Whence then comes wisdom? Where is the place of understanding? 28:21 Seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the birds of the sky. 28:22 Destruction and Death say, 'We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.' 28:23 "God understands its way, and he knows its place. 28:24 For he looks to the ends of the earth, and sees under the whole sky. 28:25 He establishes the force of the wind. Yes, he measures out the waters by measure. 28:26 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder; 28:27 then he saw it, and declared it. He established it, yes, and searched it out. 28:28 To man he said, 'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom. To depart from evil is understanding.'"
