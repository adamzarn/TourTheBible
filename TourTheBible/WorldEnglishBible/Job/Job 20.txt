Then Zophar the Naamathite answered, 20:2 "Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, even by reason of my haste that is in me. 20:3 I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame. The spirit of my understanding answers me. 20:4 Don't you know this from old time, since man was placed on earth, 20:5 that the triumphing of the wicked is short, the joy of the godless but for a moment? 20:6 Though his height mount up to the heavens, and his head reach to the clouds, 20:7 yet he shall perish forever like his own dung. Those who have seen him shall say, 'Where is he?' 20:8 He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found. Yes, he shall be chased away like a vision of the night. 20:9 The eye which saw him shall see him no more, neither shall his place any more see him. 20:10 His children shall seek the favor of the poor. His hands shall give back his wealth. 20:11 His bones are full of his youth, but youth shall lie down with him in the dust. 20:12 "Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue, 20:13 though he spare it, and will not let it go, but keep it still within his mouth; 20:14 yet his food in his bowels is turned. It is cobra venom within him. 20:15 He has swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again. God will cast them out of his belly. 20:16 He shall suck cobra venom. The viper's tongue shall kill him. 20:17 He shall not look at the rivers, the flowing streams of honey and butter. 20:18 That for which he labored he shall restore, and shall not swallow it down. According to the substance that he has gotten, he shall not rejoice. 20:19 For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor. He has violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up. 20:20 "Because he knew no quietness within him, he shall not save anything of that in which he delights. 20:21 There was nothing left that he didn't devour, therefore his prosperity shall not endure. 20:22 In the fullness of his sufficiency, distress shall overtake him. The hand of everyone who is in misery shall come on him. 20:23 When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him. It will rain on him while he is eating. 20:24 He shall flee from the iron weapon. The bronze arrow shall strike him through. 20:25 He draws it forth, and it comes out of his body. Yes, the glittering point comes out of his liver. Terrors are on him. 20:26 All darkness is laid up for his treasures. An unfanned fire shall devour him. It shall consume that which is left in his tent. 20:27 The heavens shall reveal his iniquity. The earth shall rise up against him. 20:28 The increase of his house shall depart. They shall rush away in the day of his wrath. 20:29 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, the heritage appointed to him by God."
