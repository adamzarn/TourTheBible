Then Job answered, 12:2 "No doubt, but you are the people, and wisdom shall die with you. 12:3 But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Yes, who doesn't know such things as these? 12:4 I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor, I, who called on God, and he answered. The just, the blameless man is a joke. 12:5 In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune. It is ready for them whose foot slips. 12:6 The tents of robbers prosper. Those who provoke God are secure, who carry their God in their hands. 12:7 "But ask the animals, now, and they shall teach you; the birds of the sky, and they shall tell you. 12:8 Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach you. The fish of the sea shall declare to you. 12:9 Who doesn't know that in all these, the hand of Yahweh has done this, 12:10 in whose hand is the life of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind? 12:11 Doesn't the ear try words, even as the palate tastes its food? 12:12 With aged men is wisdom, in length of days understanding. 12:13 "With God is wisdom and might. He has counsel and understanding. 12:14 Behold, he breaks down, and it can't be built again. He imprisons a man, and there can be no release. 12:15 Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up. Again, he sends them out, and they overturn the earth. 12:16 With him is strength and wisdom. The deceived and the deceiver are his. 12:17 He leads counselors away stripped. He makes judges fools. 12:18 He loosens the bond of kings. He binds their waist with a belt. 12:19 He leads priests away stripped, and overthrows the mighty. 12:20 He removes the speech of those who are trusted, and takes away the understanding of the elders. 12:21 He pours contempt on princes, and loosens the belt of the strong. 12:22 He uncovers deep things out of darkness, and brings out to light the shadow of death. 12:23 He increases the nations, and he destroys them. He enlarges the nations, and he leads them captive. 12:24 He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth, and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way. 12:25 They grope in the dark without light. He makes them stagger like a drunken man.
