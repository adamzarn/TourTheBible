Moreover Yahweh answered Job, 40:2 "Shall he who argues contend with the Almighty? He who argues with God, let him answer it." 40:3 Then Job answered Yahweh, 40:4 "Behold, I am of small account. What shall I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth. 40:5 I have spoken once, and I will not answer; Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further." 40:6 Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind, 40:7 "Now brace yourself like a man. I will question you, and you will answer me. 40:8 Will you even annul my judgment? Will you condemn me, that you may be justified? 40:9 Or do you have an arm like God? Can you thunder with a voice like him? 40:10 "Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity. Array yourself with honor and majesty. 40:11 Pour out the fury of your anger. Look at everyone who is proud, and bring him low. 40:12 Look at everyone who is proud, and humble him. Crush the wicked in their place. 40:13 Hide them in the dust together. Bind their faces in the hidden place. 40:14 Then I will also admit to you that your own right hand can save you. 40:15 "See now, behemoth, which I made as well as you. He eats grass as an ox. 40:16 Look now, his strength is in his thighs. His force is in the muscles of his belly. 40:17 He moves his tail like a cedar. The sinews of his thighs are knit together. 40:18 His bones are like tubes of brass. His limbs are like bars of iron. 40:19 He is the chief of the ways of God. He who made him gives him his sword. 40:20 Surely the mountains produce food for him, where all the animals of the field play. 40:21 He lies under the lotus trees, in the covert of the reed, and the marsh. 40:22 The lotuses cover him with their shade. The willows of the brook surround him. 40:23 Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn't tremble. He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his mouth. 40:24 Shall any take him when he is on the watch, or pierce through his nose with a snare?
