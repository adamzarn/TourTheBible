Then Zophar, the Naamathite, answered, 11:2 "Shouldn't the multitude of words be answered? Should a man full of talk be justified? 11:3 Should your boastings make men hold their peace? When you mock, shall no man make you ashamed? 11:4 For you say, 'My doctrine is pure. I am clean in your eyes.' 11:5 But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against you, 11:6 that he would show you the secrets of wisdom! For true wisdom has two sides. Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves. 11:7 "Can you fathom the mystery of God? Or can you probe the limits of the Almighty? 11:8 They are high as heaven. What can you do? They are deeper than Sheol. What can you know? 11:9 Its measure is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. 11:10 If he passes by, or confines, or convenes a court, then who can oppose him? 11:11 For he knows false men. He sees iniquity also, even though he doesn't consider it. 11:12 An empty-headed man becomes wise when a man is born as a wild donkey's colt. 11:13 "If you set your heart aright, stretch out your hands toward him. 11:14 If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away. Don't let unrighteousness dwell in your tents. 11:15 Surely then shall you lift up your face without spot; Yes, you shall be steadfast, and shall not fear: 11:16 for you shall forget your misery. You shall remember it as waters that are passed away. 11:17 Life shall be clearer than the noonday. Though there is darkness, it shall be as the morning. 11:18 You shall be secure, because there is hope. Yes, you shall search, and shall take your rest in safety. 11:19 Also you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid. Yes, many shall court your favor. 11:20 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail. They shall have no way to flee. Their hope shall be the giving up of the spirit."
