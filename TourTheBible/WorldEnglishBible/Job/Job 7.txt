"Isn't a man forced to labor on earth? Aren't his days like the days of a hired hand? 7:2 As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow, as a hireling who looks for his wages, 7:3 so am I made to possess months of misery, wearisome nights are appointed to me. 7:4 When I lie down, I say, 'When shall I arise, and the night be gone?' I toss and turn until the dawning of the day. 7:5 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust. My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh. 7:6 My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope. 7:7 Oh remember that my life is a breath. My eye shall no more see good. 7:8 The eye of him who sees me shall see me no more. Your eyes shall be on me, but I shall not be. 7:9 As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he who goes down to Sheol shall come up no more. 7:10 He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more. 7:11 "Therefore I will not keep silent. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit. I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 7:12 Am I a sea, or a sea monster, that you put a guard over me? 7:13 When I say, 'My bed shall comfort me. My couch shall ease my complaint;' 7:14 then you scare me with dreams, and terrify me through visions: 7:15 so that my soul chooses strangling, death rather than my bones. 7:16 I loathe my life. I don't want to live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath. 7:17 What is man, that you should magnify him, that you should set your mind on him, 7:18 that you should visit him every morning, and test him every moment? 7:19 How long will you not look away from me, nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle? 7:20 If I have sinned, what do I do to you, you watcher of men? Why have you set me as a mark for you, so that I am a burden to myself? 7:21 Why do you not pardon my disobedience, and take away my iniquity? For now shall I lie down in the dust. You will seek me diligently, but I shall not be."
