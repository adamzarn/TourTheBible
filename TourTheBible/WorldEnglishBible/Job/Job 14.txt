"Man, who is born of a woman, is of few days, and full of trouble. 14:2 He comes forth like a flower, and is cut down. He also flees like a shadow, and doesn't continue. 14:3 Do you open your eyes on such a one, and bring me into judgment with you? 14:4 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one. 14:5 Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months is with you, and you have appointed his bounds that he can't pass; 14:6 Look away from him, that he may rest, until he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day. 14:7 "For there is hope for a tree, If it is cut down, that it will sprout again, that the tender branch of it will not cease. 14:8 Though its root grows old in the earth, and its stock dies in the ground, 14:9 yet through the scent of water it will bud, and put forth boughs like a plant. 14:10 But man dies, and is laid low. Yes, man gives up the spirit, and where is he? 14:11 As the waters fail from the sea, and the river wastes and dries up, 14:12 so man lies down and doesn't rise. Until the heavens are no more, they shall not awake, nor be roused out of their sleep. 14:13 "Oh that you would hide me in Sheol, that you would keep me secret, until your wrath is past, that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me! 14:14 If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my warfare would I wait, until my release should come. 14:15 You would call, and I would answer you. You would have a desire to the work of your hands. 14:16 But now you number my steps. Don't you watch over my sin? 14:17 My disobedience is sealed up in a bag. You fasten up my iniquity. 14:18 "But the mountain falling comes to nothing. The rock is removed out of its place; 14:19 The waters wear the stones. The torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth. So you destroy the hope of man. 14:20 You forever prevail against him, and he departs. You change his face, and send him away. 14:21 His sons come to honor, and he doesn't know it. They are brought low, but he doesn't perceive it of them. 14:22 But his flesh on him has pain, and his soul within him mourns."
