"Yes, at this my heart trembles, and is moved out of its place. 37:2 Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice, the sound that goes out of his mouth. 37:3 He sends it forth under the whole sky, and his lightning to the ends of the earth. 37:4 After it a voice roars. He thunders with the voice of his majesty. He doesn't hold back anything when his voice is heard. 37:5 God thunders marvelously with his voice. He does great things, which we can't comprehend. 37:6 For he says to the snow, 'Fall on the earth;' likewise to the shower of rain, and to the showers of his mighty rain. 37:7 He seals up the hand of every man, that all men whom he has made may know it. 37:8 Then the animals take cover, and remain in their dens. 37:9 Out of its chamber comes the storm, and cold out of the north. 37:10 By the breath of God, ice is given, and the breadth of the waters is frozen. 37:11 Yes, he loads the thick cloud with moisture. He spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning. 37:12 It is turned round about by his guidance, that they may do whatever he commands them on the surface of the habitable world, 37:13 Whether it is for correction, or for his land, or for loving kindness, that he causes it to come. 37:14 "Listen to this, Job. Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. 37:15 Do you know how God controls them, and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine? 37:16 Do you know the workings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge? 37:17 You whose clothing is warm, when the earth is still by reason of the south wind? 37:18 Can you, with him, spread out the sky, which is strong as a cast metal mirror? 37:19 Teach us what we shall tell him, for we can't make our case by reason of darkness. 37:20 Shall it be told him that I would speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up? 37:21 Now men don't see the light which is bright in the skies, but the wind passes, and clears them. 37:22 Out of the north comes golden splendor. With God is awesome majesty. 37:23 We can't reach the Almighty. He is exalted in power. In justice and great righteousness, he will not oppress. 37:24 Therefore men revere him. He doesn't regard any who are wise of heart."
