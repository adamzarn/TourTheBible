Moreover Elihu answered, 34:2 "Hear my words, you wise men. Give ear to me, you who have knowledge. 34:3 For the ear tries words, as the palate tastes food. 34:4 Let us choose for us that which is right. Let us know among ourselves what is good. 34:5 For Job has said, 'I am righteous, God has taken away my right: 34:6 Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar. My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.' 34:7 What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water, 34:8 Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men? 34:9 For he has said, 'It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.' 34:10 "Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. 34:11 For the work of a man he will render to him, and cause every man to find according to his ways. 34:12 Yes surely, God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert justice. 34:13 Who gave him a charge over the earth? or who has appointed him over the whole world? 34:14 If he set his heart on himself, If he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath, 34:15 all flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to dust. 34:16 "If now you have understanding, hear this. Listen to the voice of my words. 34:17 Shall even one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty?-- 34:18 Who says to a king, 'Vile!' or to nobles, 'Wicked!'? 34:19 Who doesn't respect the persons of princes, nor regards the rich more than the poor; for they all are the work of his hands. 34:20 In a moment they die, even at midnight. The people are shaken and pass away. The mighty are taken away without a hand. 34:21 "For his eyes are on the ways of a man. He sees all his goings. 34:22 There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. 34:23 For he doesn't need to consider a man further, that he should go before God in judgment. 34:24 He breaks in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out, and sets others in their place. 34:25 Therefore he takes knowledge of their works. He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed. 34:26 He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others; 34:27 because they turned aside from following him, and wouldn't pay attention to any of his ways, 34:28 so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him. He heard the cry of the afflicted. 34:29 When he gives quietness, who then can condemn? When he hides his face, who then can see him? Alike whether to a nation, or to a man, 34:30 that the godless man may not reign, that there be no one to ensnare the people. 34:31 "For has any said to God, 'I am guilty, but I will not offend any more. 34:32 Teach me that which I don't see. If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more'? 34:33 Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it? For you must choose, and not I. Therefore speak what you know. 34:34 Men of understanding will tell me, yes, every wise man who hears me: 34:35 'Job speaks without knowledge. His words are without wisdom.' 34:36 I wish that Job were tried to the end, because of his answering like wicked men. 34:37 For he adds rebellion to his sin. He claps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against God."
