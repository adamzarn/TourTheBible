Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, 4:2 "If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved? But who can withhold himself from speaking? 4:3 Behold, you have instructed many, you have strengthened the weak hands. 4:4 Your words have supported him who was falling, You have made firm the feeble knees. 4:5 But now it is come to you, and you faint. It touches you, and you are troubled. 4:6 Isn't your piety your confidence? Isn't the integrity of your ways your hope? 4:7 "Remember, now, whoever perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off? 4:8 According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity, and sow trouble, reap the same. 4:9 By the breath of God they perish. By the blast of his anger are they consumed. 4:10 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions, are broken. 4:11 The old lion perishes for lack of prey. The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad. 4:12 "Now a thing was secretly brought to me. My ear received a whisper of it. 4:13 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, 4:14 fear came on me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake. 4:15 Then a spirit passed before my face. The hair of my flesh stood up. 4:16 It stood still, but I couldn't discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes. Silence, then I heard a voice, saying, 4:17 'Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his Maker? 4:18 Behold, he puts no trust in his servants. He charges his angels with error. 4:19 How much more, those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth! 4:20 Between morning and evening they are destroyed. They perish forever without any regarding it. 4:21 Isn't their tent cord plucked up within them? They die, and that without wisdom.'
