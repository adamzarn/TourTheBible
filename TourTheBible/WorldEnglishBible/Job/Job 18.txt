Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, 18:2 "How long will you hunt for words? Consider, and afterwards we will speak. 18:3 Why are we counted as animals, which have become unclean in your sight? 18:4 You who tear yourself in your anger, shall the earth be forsaken for you? Or shall the rock be removed out of its place? 18:5 "Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, The spark of his fire shall not shine. 18:6 The light shall be dark in his tent. His lamp above him shall be put out. 18:7 The steps of his strength shall be shortened. His own counsel shall cast him down. 18:8 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he wanders into its mesh. 18:9 A snare will take him by the heel. A trap will catch him. 18:10 A noose is hidden for him in the ground, a trap for him in the way. 18:11 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall chase him at his heels. 18:12 His strength shall be famished. Calamity shall be ready at his side. 18:13 The members of his body shall be devoured. The firstborn of death shall devour his members. 18:14 He shall be rooted out of his tent where he trusts. He shall be brought to the king of terrors. 18:15 There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his. Sulfur shall be scattered on his habitation. 18:16 His roots shall be dried up beneath. Above shall his branch be cut off. 18:17 His memory shall perish from the earth. He shall have no name in the street. 18:18 He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world. 18:19 He shall have neither son nor grandson among his people, nor any remaining where he sojourned. 18:20 Those who come after shall be astonished at his day, as those who went before were frightened. 18:21 Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous. This is the place of him who doesn't know God."
