"Do you know the time when the mountain goats give birth? Do you watch when the doe bears fawns? 39:2 Can you number the months that they fulfill? Or do you know the time when they give birth? 39:3 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, they end their labor pains. 39:4 Their young ones become strong. They grow up in the open field. They go forth, and don't return again. 39:5 "Who has set the wild donkey free? Or who has loosened the bonds of the swift donkey, 39:6 Whose home I have made the wilderness, and the salt land his dwelling place? 39:7 He scorns the tumult of the city, neither does he hear the shouting of the driver. 39:8 The range of the mountains is his pasture, He searches after every green thing. 39:9 "Will the wild ox be content to serve you? Or will he stay by your feeding trough? 39:10 Can you hold the wild ox in the furrow with his harness? Or will he till the valleys after you? 39:11 Will you trust him, because his strength is great? Or will you leave to him your labor? 39:12 Will you confide in him, that he will bring home your seed, and gather the grain of your threshing floor? 39:13 "The wings of the ostrich wave proudly; but are they the feathers and plumage of love? 39:14 For she leaves her eggs on the earth, warms them in the dust, 39:15 and forgets that the foot may crush them, or that the wild animal may trample them. 39:16 She deals harshly with her young ones, as if they were not hers. Though her labor is in vain, she is without fear, 39:17 because God has deprived her of wisdom, neither has he imparted to her understanding. 39:18 When she lifts up herself on high, she scorns the horse and his rider. 39:19 "Have you given the horse might? Have you clothed his neck with a quivering mane? 39:20 Have you made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is awesome. 39:21 He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength. He goes out to meet the armed men. 39:22 He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed, neither does he turn back from the sword. 39:23 The quiver rattles against him, the flashing spear and the javelin. 39:24 He eats up the ground with fierceness and rage, neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet. 39:25 As often as the trumpet sounds he snorts, 'Aha!' He smells the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 39:26 "Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars, and stretches her wings toward the south? 39:27 Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up, and makes his nest on high? 39:28 On the cliff he dwells, and makes his home, on the point of the cliff, and the stronghold. 39:29 From there he spies out the prey. His eyes see it afar off. 39:30 His young ones also suck up blood. Where the slain are, there he is."
