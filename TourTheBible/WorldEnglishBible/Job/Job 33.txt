"However, Job, Please hear my speech, and listen to all my words. 33:2 See now, I have opened my mouth. My tongue has spoken in my mouth. 33:3 My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart. That which my lips know they shall speak sincerely. 33:4 The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life. 33:5 If you can, answer me. Set your words in order before me, and stand forth. 33:6 Behold, I am toward God even as you are. I am also formed out of the clay. 33:7 Behold, my terror shall not make you afraid, neither shall my pressure be heavy on you. 33:8 "Surely you have spoken in my hearing, I have heard the voice of your words, saying, 33:9 'I am clean, without disobedience. I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me. 33:10 Behold, he finds occasions against me. He counts me for his enemy. 33:11 He puts my feet in the stocks. He marks all my paths.' 33:12 "Behold, I will answer you. In this you are not just, for God is greater than man. 33:13 Why do you strive against him, because he doesn't give account of any of his matters? 33:14 For God speaks once, yes twice, though man pays no attention. 33:15 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, in slumbering on the bed; 33:16 Then he opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction, 33:17 That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man. 33:18 He keeps back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. 33:19 He is chastened also with pain on his bed, with continual strife in his bones; 33:20 So that his life abhors bread, and his soul dainty food. 33:21 His flesh is so consumed away, that it can't be seen. His bones that were not seen stick out. 33:22 Yes, his soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the destroyers. 33:23 "If there is beside him an angel, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man what is right for him; 33:24 then God is gracious to him, and says, 'Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.' 33:25 His flesh shall be fresher than a child's. He returns to the days of his youth. 33:26 He prays to God, and he is favorable to him, so that he sees his face with joy. He restores to man his righteousness. 33:27 He sings before men, and says, 'I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it didn't profit me. 33:28 He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit. My life shall see the light.' 33:29 "Behold, God works all these things, twice, yes three times, with a man, 33:30 to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living. 33:31 Mark well, Job, and listen to me. Hold your peace, and I will speak. 33:32 If you have anything to say, answer me. Speak, for I desire to justify you. 33:33 If not, listen to me. Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom."
