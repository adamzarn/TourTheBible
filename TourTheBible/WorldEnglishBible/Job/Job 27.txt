Job again took up his parable, and said, 27:2 "As God lives, who has taken away my right, the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter. 27:3 (For the length of my life is still in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils); 27:4 surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness, neither shall my tongue utter deceit. 27:5 Far be it from me that I should justify you. Until I die I will not put away my integrity from me. 27:6 I hold fast to my righteousness, and will not let it go. My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live. 27:7 "Let my enemy be as the wicked. Let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous. 27:8 For what is the hope of the godless, when he is cut off, when God takes away his life? 27:9 Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him? 27:10 Will he delight himself in the Almighty, and call on God at all times? 27:11 I will teach you about the hand of God. That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal. 27:12 Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain? 27:13 "This is the portion of a wicked man with God, the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty. 27:14 If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword. His offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. 27:15 Those who remain of him shall be buried in death. His widows shall make no lamentation. 27:16 Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare clothing as the clay; 27:17 he may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver. 27:18 He builds his house as the moth, as a booth which the watchman makes. 27:19 He lies down rich, but he shall not do so again. He opens his eyes, and he is not. 27:20 Terrors overtake him like waters. A storm steals him away in the night. 27:21 The east wind carries him away, and he departs. It sweeps him out of his place. 27:22 For it hurls at him, and does not spare, as he flees away from his hand. 27:23 Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.
