Elihu also continued, and said, 36:2 "Bear with me a little, and I will show you; for I still have something to say on God's behalf. 36:3 I will get my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 36:4 For truly my words are not false. One who is perfect in knowledge is with you. 36:5 "Behold, God is mighty, and doesn't despise anyone. He is mighty in strength of understanding. 36:6 He doesn't preserve the life of the wicked, but gives to the afflicted their right. 36:7 He doesn't withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but with kings on the throne, he sets them forever, and they are exalted. 36:8 If they are bound in fetters, and are taken in the cords of afflictions, 36:9 then he shows them their work, and their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly. 36:10 He also opens their ears to instruction, and commands that they return from iniquity. 36:11 If they listen and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. 36:12 But if they don't listen, they shall perish by the sword; they shall die without knowledge. 36:13 "But those who are godless in heart lay up anger. They don't cry for help when he binds them. 36:14 They die in youth. Their life perishes among the unclean. 36:15 He delivers the afflicted by their affliction, and opens their ear in oppression. 36:16 Yes, he would have allured you out of distress, into a broad place, where there is no restriction. That which is set on your table would be full of fatness. 36:17 "But you are full of the judgment of the wicked. Judgment and justice take hold of you. 36:18 Don't let riches entice you to wrath, neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside. 36:19 Would your wealth sustain you in distress, or all the might of your strength? 36:20 Don't desire the night, when people are cut off in their place. 36:21 Take heed, don't regard iniquity; for you have chosen this rather than affliction. 36:22 Behold, God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him? 36:23 Who has prescribed his way for him? Or who can say, 'You have committed unrighteousness?' 36:24 "Remember that you magnify his work, whereof men have sung. 36:25 All men have looked thereon. Man sees it afar off. 36:26 Behold, God is great, and we don't know him. The number of his years is unsearchable. 36:27 For he draws up the drops of water, which distill in rain from his vapor, 36:28 Which the skies pour down and which drop on man abundantly. 36:29 Yes, can any understand the spreading of the clouds, and the thunderings of his pavilion? 36:30 Behold, he spreads his light around him. He covers the bottom of the sea. 36:31 For by these he judges the people. He gives food in abundance. 36:32 He covers his hands with the lightning, and commands it to strike the mark. 36:33 Its noise tells about him, and the livestock also concerning the storm that comes up.
