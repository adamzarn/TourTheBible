"I made a covenant with my eyes, how then should I look lustfully at a young woman? 31:2 For what is the portion from God above, and the heritage from the Almighty on high? 31:3 Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, and disaster to the workers of iniquity? 31:4 Doesn't he see my ways, and number all my steps? 31:5 "If I have walked with falsehood, and my foot has hurried to deceit 31:6 (let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know my integrity); 31:7 if my step has turned out of the way, if my heart walked after my eyes, if any defilement has stuck to my hands, 31:8 then let me sow, and let another eat. Yes, let the produce of my field be rooted out. 31:9 "If my heart has been enticed to a woman, and I have laid wait at my neighbor's door, 31:10 then let my wife grind for another, and let others sleep with her. 31:11 For that would be a heinous crime. Yes, it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges: 31:12 For it is a fire that consumes to destruction, and would root out all my increase. 31:13 "If I have despised the cause of my male servant or of my female servant, when they contended with me; 31:14 What then shall I do when God rises up? When he visits, what shall I answer him? 31:15 Didn't he who made me in the womb make him? Didn't one fashion us in the womb? 31:16 "If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail, 31:17 or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless has not eaten of it 31:18 (no, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, her have I guided from my mother's womb); 31:19 if I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or that the needy had no covering; 31:20 if his heart hasn't blessed me, if he hasn't been warmed with my sheep's fleece; 31:21 if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate, 31:22 then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade, and my arm be broken from the bone. 31:23 For calamity from God is a terror to me. Because his majesty, I can do nothing. 31:24 "If I have made gold my hope, and have said to the fine gold, 'You are my confidence;' 31:25 If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gotten much; 31:26 if I have seen the sun when it shined, or the moon moving in splendor, 31:27 and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth, 31:28 this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges; for I should have denied the God who is above. 31:29 "If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him; 31:30 (yes, I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse); 31:31 if the men of my tent have not said, 'Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat?' 31:32 (the foreigner has not lodged in the street, but I have opened my doors to the traveler); 31:33 if like Adam I have covered my transgressions, by hiding my iniquity in my heart, 31:34 because I feared the great multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and didn't go out of the door-- 31:35 oh that I had one to hear me! (behold, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me); let the accuser write my indictment! 31:36 Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; and I would bind it to me as a crown. 31:37 I would declare to him the number of my steps. as a prince would I go near to him. 31:38 If my land cries out against me, and the furrows of it weep together; 31:39 if I have eaten the fruits of it without money, or have caused the owners of it to lose their life, 31:40 let briars grow instead of wheat, and stinkweed instead of barley." The words of Job are ended.
