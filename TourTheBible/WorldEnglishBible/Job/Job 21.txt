Then Job answered, 21:2 "Listen diligently to my speech. Let this be your consolation. 21:3 Allow me, and I also will speak; After I have spoken, mock on. 21:4 As for me, is my complaint to man? Why shouldn't I be impatient? 21:5 Look at me, and be astonished. Lay your hand on your mouth. 21:6 When I remember, I am troubled. Horror takes hold of my flesh. 21:7 "Why do the wicked live, become old, yes, and grow mighty in power? 21:8 Their child is established with them in their sight, their offspring before their eyes. 21:9 Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them. 21:10 Their bulls breed without fail. Their cows calve, and don't miscarry. 21:11 They send forth their little ones like a flock. Their children dance. 21:12 They sing to the tambourine and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the pipe. 21:13 They spend their days in prosperity. In an instant they go down to Sheol. 21:14 They tell God, 'Depart from us, for we don't want to know about your ways. 21:15 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What profit should we have, if we pray to him?' 21:16 Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand. The counsel of the wicked is far from me. 21:17 "How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out, that their calamity comes on them, that God distributes sorrows in his anger? 21:18 How often is it that they are as stubble before the wind, as chaff that the storm carries away? 21:19 You say, 'God lays up his iniquity for his children.' Let him recompense it to himself, that he may know it. 21:20 Let his own eyes see his destruction. Let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 21:21 For what does he care for his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off? 21:22 "Shall any teach God knowledge, seeing he judges those who are high? 21:23 One dies in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. 21:24 His pails are full of milk. The marrow of his bones is moistened. 21:25 Another dies in bitterness of soul, and never tastes of good. 21:26 They lie down alike in the dust. The worm covers them. 21:27 "Behold, I know your thoughts, the devices with which you would wrong me. 21:28 For you say, 'Where is the house of the prince? Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?' 21:29 Haven't you asked wayfaring men? Don't you know their evidences, 21:30 that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity, That they are led forth to the day of wrath? 21:31 Who shall declare his way to his face? Who shall repay him what he has done? 21:32 Yet he will be borne to the grave. Men shall keep watch over the tomb. 21:33 The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him. All men shall draw after him, as there were innumerable before him. 21:34 So how can you comfort me with nonsense, seeing that in your answers there remains only falsehood?"
