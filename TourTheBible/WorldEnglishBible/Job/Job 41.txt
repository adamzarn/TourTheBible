"Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook, or press down his tongue with a cord? 41:2 Can you put a rope into his nose, or pierce his jaw through with a hook? 41:3 Will he make many petitions to you, or will he speak soft words to you? 41:4 Will he make a covenant with you, that you should take him for a servant forever? 41:5 Will you play with him as with a bird? Or will you bind him for your girls? 41:6 Will traders barter for him? Will they part him among the merchants? 41:7 Can you fill his skin with barbed irons, or his head with fish spears? 41:8 Lay your hand on him. Remember the battle, and do so no more. 41:9 Behold, the hope of him is in vain. Won't one be cast down even at the sight of him? 41:10 None is so fierce that he dare stir him up. Who then is he who can stand before me? 41:11 Who has first given to me, that I should repay him? Everything under the heavens is mine. 41:12 "I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame. 41:13 Who can strip off his outer garment? Who shall come within his jaws? 41:14 Who can open the doors of his face? Around his teeth is terror. 41:15 Strong scales are his pride, shut up together with a close seal. 41:16 One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. 41:17 They are joined one to another. They stick together, so that they can't be pulled apart. 41:18 His sneezing flashes out light. His eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. 41:19 Out of his mouth go burning torches. Sparks of fire leap forth. 41:20 Out of his nostrils a smoke goes, as of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds. 41:21 His breath kindles coals. A flame goes forth from his mouth. 41:22 There is strength in his neck. Terror dances before him. 41:23 The flakes of his flesh are joined together. They are firm on him. They can't be moved. 41:24 His heart is as firm as a stone, yes, firm as the lower millstone. 41:25 When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid. They retreat before his thrashing. 41:26 If one attacks him with the sword, it can't prevail; nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft. 41:27 He counts iron as straw; and brass as rotten wood. 41:28 The arrow can't make him flee. Sling stones are like chaff to him. 41:29 Clubs are counted as stubble. He laughs at the rushing of the javelin. 41:30 His undersides are like sharp potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge. 41:31 He makes the deep to boil like a pot. He makes the sea like a pot of ointment. 41:32 He makes a path shine after him. One would think the deep had white hair. 41:33 On earth there is not his equal, that is made without fear. 41:34 He sees everything that is high. He is king over all the sons of pride."
