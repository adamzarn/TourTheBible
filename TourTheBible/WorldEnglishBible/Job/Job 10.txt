"My soul is weary of my life. I will give free course to my complaint. I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 10:2 I will tell God, 'Do not condemn me. Show me why you contend with me. 10:3 Is it good to you that you should oppress, that you should despise the work of your hands, and smile on the counsel of the wicked? 10:4 Do you have eyes of flesh? Or do you see as man sees? 10:5 Are your days as the days of mortals, or your years as man's years, 10:6 that you inquire after my iniquity, and search after my sin? 10:7 Although you know that I am not wicked, there is no one who can deliver out of your hand. 10:8 "'Your hands have framed me and fashioned me altogether, yet you destroy me. 10:9 Remember, I beg you, that you have fashioned me as clay. Will you bring me into dust again? 10:10 Haven't you poured me out like milk, and curdled me like cheese? 10:11 You have clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews. 10:12 You have granted me life and loving kindness. Your visitation has preserved my spirit. 10:13 Yet you hid these things in your heart. I know that this is with you: 10:14 if I sin, then you mark me. You will not acquit me from my iniquity. 10:15 If I am wicked, woe to me. If I am righteous, I still shall not lift up my head, being filled with disgrace, and conscious of my affliction. 10:16 If my head is held high, you hunt me like a lion. Again you show yourself powerful to me. 10:17 You renew your witnesses against me, and increase your indignation on me. Changes and warfare are with me. 10:18 "'Why, then, have you brought me forth out of the womb? I wish I had given up the spirit, and no eye had seen me. 10:19 I should have been as though I had not been. I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. 10:20 Aren't my days few? Cease then. Leave me alone, that I may find a little comfort, 10:21 before I go where I shall not return from, to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death; 10:22 the land dark as midnight, of the shadow of death, without any order, where the light is as midnight.'"
