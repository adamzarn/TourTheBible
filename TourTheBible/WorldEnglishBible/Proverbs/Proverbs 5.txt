My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Turn your ear to my understanding: 5:2 that you may maintain discretion, that your lips may preserve knowledge. 5:3 For the lips of an adulteress drip honey. Her mouth is smoother than oil, 5:4 But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a two-edged sword. 5:5 Her feet go down to death. Her steps lead straight to Sheol. 5:6 She gives no thought to the way of life. Her ways are crooked, and she doesn't know it. 5:7 Now therefore, my sons, listen to me. Don't depart from the words of my mouth. 5:8 Remove your way far from her. Don't come near the door of her house, 5:9 lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel one; 5:10 lest strangers feast on your wealth, and your labors enrich another man's house. 5:11 You will groan at your latter end, when your flesh and your body are consumed, 5:12 and say, "How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; 5:13 neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor turned my ear to those who instructed me! 5:14 I have come to the brink of utter ruin, in the midst of the gathered assembly." 5:15 Drink water out of your own cistern, running water out of your own well. 5:16 Should your springs overflow in the streets, streams of water in the public squares? 5:17 Let them be for yourself alone, not for strangers with you. 5:18 Let your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 5:19 A loving doe and a graceful deer--let her breasts satisfy you at all times. Be captivated always with her love. 5:20 For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of another? 5:21 For the ways of man are before the eyes of Yahweh. He examines all his paths. 5:22 The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him. The cords of his sin hold him firmly. 5:23 He will die for lack of instruction. In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray.
