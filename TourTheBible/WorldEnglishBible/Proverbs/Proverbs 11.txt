A false balance is an abomination to Yahweh, but accurate weights are his delight. 11:2 When pride comes, then comes shame, but with humility comes wisdom. 11:3 The integrity of the upright shall guide them, but the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them. 11:4 Riches don't profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death. 11:5 The righteousness of the blameless will direct his way, but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness. 11:6 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them, but the unfaithful will be trapped by evil desires. 11:7 When a wicked man dies, hope perishes, and expectation of power comes to nothing. 11:8 A righteous person is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked takes his place. 11:9 With his mouth the godless man destroys his neighbor, but the righteous will be delivered through knowledge. 11:10 When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices. When the wicked perish, there is shouting. 11:11 By the blessing of the upright, the city is exalted, but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked. 11:12 One who despises his neighbor is void of wisdom, but a man of understanding holds his peace. 11:13 One who brings gossip betrays a confidence, but one who is of a trustworthy spirit is one who keeps a secret. 11:14 Where there is no wise guidance, the nation falls, but in the multitude of counselors there is victory. 11:15 He who is collateral for a stranger will suffer for it, but he who refuses pledges of collateral is secure. 11:16 A gracious woman obtains honor, but violent men obtain riches. 11:17 The merciful man does good to his own soul, but he who is cruel troubles his own flesh. 11:18 Wicked people earn deceitful wages, but one who sows righteousness reaps a sure reward. 11:19 He who is truly righteous gets life. He who pursues evil gets death. 11:20 Those who are perverse in heart are an abomination to Yahweh, but those whose ways are blameless are his delight. 11:21 Most certainly, the evil man will not be unpunished, but the seed of the righteous will be delivered. 11:22 Like a gold ring in a pig's snout, is a beautiful woman who lacks discretion. 11:23 The desire of the righteous is only good. The expectation of the wicked is wrath. 11:24 There is one who scatters, and increases yet more. There is one who withholds more than is appropriate, but gains poverty. 11:25 The liberal soul shall be made fat. He who waters shall be watered also himself. 11:26 People curse someone who withholds grain, but blessing will be on the head of him who sells it. 11:27 He who diligently seeks good seeks favor, but he who searches after evil, it shall come to him. 11:28 He who trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous shall flourish as the green leaf. 11:29 He who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind. The foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart. 11:30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life. He who is wise wins souls. 11:31 Behold, the righteous shall be repaid in the earth; how much more the wicked and the sinner!
