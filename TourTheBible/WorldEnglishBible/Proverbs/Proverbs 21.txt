The king's heart is in Yahweh's hand like the watercourses. He turns it wherever he desires. 21:2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but Yahweh weighs the hearts. 21:3 To do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to Yahweh than sacrifice. 21:4 A high look, and a proud heart, the lamp of the wicked, is sin. 21:5 The plans of the diligent surely lead to profit; and everyone who is hasty surely rushes to poverty. 21:6 Getting treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor for those who seek death. 21:7 The violence of the wicked will drive them away, because they refuse to do what is right. 21:8 The way of the guilty is devious, but the conduct of the innocent is upright. 21:9 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than to share a house with a contentious woman. 21:10 The soul of the wicked desires evil; his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes. 21:11 When the mocker is punished, the simple gains wisdom. When the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge. 21:12 The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked, and brings the wicked to ruin. 21:13 Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor, he will also cry out, but shall not be heard. 21:14 A gift in secret pacifies anger; and a bribe in the cloak, strong wrath. 21:15 It is joy to the righteous to do justice; but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. 21:16 The man who wanders out of the way of understanding shall rest in the assembly of the dead. 21:17 He who loves pleasure shall be a poor man. He who loves wine and oil shall not be rich. 21:18 The wicked is a ransom for the righteous; the treacherous for the upright. 21:19 It is better to dwell in a desert land, than with a contentious and fretful woman. 21:20 There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man swallows it up. 21:21 He who follows after righteousness and kindness finds life, righteousness, and honor. 21:22 A wise man scales the city of the mighty, and brings down the strength of its confidence. 21:23 Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from troubles. 21:24 The proud and haughty man, "scoffer" is his name; he works in the arrogance of pride. 21:25 The desire of the sluggard kills him, for his hands refuse to labor. 21:26 There are those who covet greedily all day long; but the righteous give and don't withhold. 21:27 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination: how much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind! 21:28 A false witness will perish, and a man who listens speaks to eternity. 21:29 A wicked man hardens his face; but as for the upright, he establishes his ways. 21:30 There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against Yahweh. 21:31 The horse is prepared for the day of battle; but victory is with Yahweh.
