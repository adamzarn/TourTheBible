The plans of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue is from Yahweh. 16:2 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but Yahweh weighs the motives. 16:3 Commit your deeds to Yahweh, and your plans shall succeed. 16:4 Yahweh has made everything for its own end--yes, even the wicked for the day of evil. 16:5 Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to Yahweh: they shall certainly not be unpunished. 16:6 By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for. By the fear of Yahweh men depart from evil. 16:7 When a man's ways please Yahweh, he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him. 16:8 Better is a little with righteousness, than great revenues with injustice. 16:9 A man's heart plans his course, but Yahweh directs his steps. 16:10 Inspired judgments are on the lips of the king. He shall not betray his mouth. 16:11 Honest balances and scales are Yahweh's; all the weights in the bag are his work. 16:12 It is an abomination for kings to do wrong, for the throne is established by righteousness. 16:13 Righteous lips are the delight of kings. They value one who speaks the truth. 16:14 The king's wrath is a messenger of death, but a wise man will pacify it. 16:15 In the light of the king's face is life. His favor is like a cloud of the spring rain. 16:16 How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! Yes, to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver. 16:17 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil. He who keeps his way preserves his soul. 16:18 Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. 16:19 It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, than to divide the plunder with the proud. 16:20 He who heeds the Word finds prosperity. Whoever trusts in Yahweh is blessed. 16:21 The wise in heart shall be called prudent. Pleasantness of the lips promotes instruction. 16:22 Understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it, but the punishment of fools is their folly. 16:23 The heart of the wise instructs his mouth, and adds learning to his lips. 16:24 Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. 16:25 There is a way which seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death. 16:26 The appetite of the laboring man labors for him; for his mouth urges him on. 16:27 A worthless man devises mischief. His speech is like a scorching fire. 16:28 A perverse man stirs up strife. A whisperer separates close friends. 16:29 A man of violence entices his neighbor, and leads him in a way that is not good. 16:30 One who winks his eyes to plot perversities, one who compresses his lips, is bent on evil. 16:31 Gray hair is a crown of glory. It is attained by a life of righteousness. 16:32 One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty; one who rules his spirit, than he who takes a city. 16:33 The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from Yahweh.
