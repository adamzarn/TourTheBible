When you sit to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before you; 23:2 put a knife to your throat, if you are a man given to appetite. 23:3 Don't be desirous of his dainties, seeing they are deceitful food. 23:4 Don't weary yourself to be rich. In your wisdom, show restraint. 23:5 Why do you set your eyes on that which is not? For it certainly sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky. 23:6 Don't eat the food of him who has a stingy eye, and don't crave his delicacies: 23:7 for as he thinks about the cost, so he is. "Eat and drink!" he says to you, but his heart is not with you. 23:8 The morsel which you have eaten you shall vomit up, and lose your good words. 23:9 Don't speak in the ears of a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of your words. 23:10 Don't move the ancient boundary stone. Don't encroach on the fields of the fatherless: 23:11 for their Defender is strong. He will plead their case against you. 23:12 Apply your heart to instruction, and your ears to the words of knowledge. 23:13 Don't withhold correction from a child. If you punish him with the rod, he will not die. 23:14 Punish him with the rod, and save his soul from Sheol. 23:15 My son, if your heart is wise, then my heart will be glad, even mine: 23:16 yes, my heart will rejoice, when your lips speak what is right. 23:17 Don't let your heart envy sinners; but rather fear Yahweh all the day long. 23:18 Indeed surely there is a future hope, and your hope will not be cut off. 23:19 Listen, my son, and be wise, and keep your heart on the right path! 23:20 Don't be among ones drinking too much wine, or those who gorge themselves on meat: 23:21 for the drunkard and the glutton shall become poor; and drowsiness clothes them in rags. 23:22 Listen to your father who gave you life, and don't despise your mother when she is old. 23:23 Buy the truth, and don't sell it. Get wisdom, discipline, and understanding. 23:24 The father of the righteous has great joy. Whoever fathers a wise child delights in him. 23:25 Let your father and your mother be glad! Let her who bore you rejoice! 23:26 My son, give me your heart; and let your eyes keep in my ways. 23:27 For a prostitute is a deep pit; and a wayward wife is a narrow well. 23:28 Yes, she lies in wait like a robber, and increases the unfaithful among men. 23:29 Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes? 23:30 Those who stay long at the wine; those who go to seek out mixed wine. 23:31 Don't look at the wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly. 23:32 In the end, it bites like a snake, and poisons like a viper. 23:33 Your eyes will see strange things, and your mind will imagine confusing things. 23:34 Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the midst of the sea, or as he who lies on top of the rigging: 23:35 "They hit me, and I was not hurt! They beat me, and I don't feel it! When will I wake up? I can do it again. I can find another."
