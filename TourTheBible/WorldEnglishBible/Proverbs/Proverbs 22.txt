A good name is more desirable than great riches, and loving favor is better than silver and gold. 22:2 The rich and the poor have this in common: Yahweh is the maker of them all. 22:3 A prudent man sees danger, and hides himself; but the simple pass on, and suffer for it. 22:4 The result of humility and the fear of Yahweh is wealth, honor, and life. 22:5 Thorns and snares are in the path of the wicked: whoever guards his soul stays from them. 22:6 Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it. 22:7 The rich rule over the poor. The borrower is servant to the lender. 22:8 He who sows wickedness reaps trouble, and the rod of his fury will be destroyed. 22:9 He who has a generous eye will be blessed; for he shares his food with the poor. 22:10 Drive out the mocker, and strife will go out; yes, quarrels and insults will stop. 22:11 He who loves purity of heart and speaks gracefully is the king's friend. 22:12 The eyes of Yahweh watch over knowledge; but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful. 22:13 The sluggard says, "There is a lion outside! I will be killed in the streets!" 22:14 The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit: he who is under Yahweh's wrath will fall into it. 22:15 Folly is bound up in the heart of a child: the rod of discipline drives it far from him. 22:16 Whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and whoever gives to the rich, both come to poverty. 22:17 Turn your ear, and listen to the words of the wise. Apply your heart to my teaching. 22:18 For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you, if all of them are ready on your lips. 22:19 That your trust may be in Yahweh, I teach you today, even you. 22:20 Haven't I written to you thirty excellent things of counsel and knowledge, 22:21 To teach you truth, reliable words, to give sound answers to the ones who sent you? 22:22 Don't exploit the poor, because he is poor; and don't crush the needy in court; 22:23 for Yahweh will plead their case, and plunder the life of those who plunder them. 22:24 Don't befriend a hot-tempered man, and don't associate with one who harbors anger: 22:25 lest you learn his ways, and ensnare your soul. 22:26 Don't you be one of those who strike hands, of those who are collateral for debts. 22:27 If you don't have means to pay, why should he take away your bed from under you? 22:28 Don't move the ancient boundary stone, which your fathers have set up. 22:29 Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will serve kings. He won't serve obscure men.
