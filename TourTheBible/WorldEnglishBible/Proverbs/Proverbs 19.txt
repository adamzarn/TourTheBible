Better is the poor who walks in his integrity than he who is perverse in his lips and is a fool. 19:2 It isn't good to have zeal without knowledge; nor being hasty with one's feet and missing the way. 19:3 The foolishness of man subverts his way; his heart rages against Yahweh. 19:4 Wealth adds many friends, but the poor is separated from his friend. 19:5 A false witness shall not be unpunished. He who pours out lies shall not go free. 19:6 Many will entreat the favor of a ruler, and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts. 19:7 All the relatives of the poor shun him: how much more do his friends avoid him! He pursues them with pleas, but they are gone. 19:8 He who gets wisdom loves his own soul. He who keeps understanding shall find good. 19:9 A false witness shall not be unpunished. He who utters lies shall perish. 19:10 Delicate living is not appropriate for a fool, much less for a servant to have rule over princes. 19:11 The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger. It is his glory to overlook an offense. 19:12 The king's wrath is like the roaring of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass. 19:13 A foolish son is the calamity of his father. A wife's quarrels are a continual dripping. 19:14 House and riches are an inheritance from fathers, but a prudent wife is from Yahweh. 19:15 Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep. The idle soul shall suffer hunger. 19:16 He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul, but he who is contemptuous in his ways shall die. 19:17 He who has pity on the poor lends to Yahweh; he will reward him. 19:18 Discipline your son, for there is hope; don't be a willing party to his death. 19:19 A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty, for if you rescue him, you must do it again. 19:20 Listen to counsel and receive instruction, that you may be wise in your latter end. 19:21 There are many plans in a man's heart, but Yahweh's counsel will prevail. 19:22 That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness. A poor man is better than a liar. 19:23 The fear of Yahweh leads to life, then contentment; he rests and will not be touched by trouble. 19:24 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. 19:25 Flog a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; rebuke one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge. 19:26 He who robs his father and drives away his mother, is a son who causes shame and brings reproach. 19:27 If you stop listening to instruction, my son, you will stray from the words of knowledge. 19:28 A corrupt witness mocks justice, and the mouth of the wicked gulps down iniquity. 19:29 Penalties are prepared for scoffers, and beatings for the backs of fools.
