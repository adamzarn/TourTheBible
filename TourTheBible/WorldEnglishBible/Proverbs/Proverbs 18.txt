An unfriendly man pursues selfishness, and defies all sound judgment. 18:2 A fool has no delight in understanding, but only in revealing his own opinion. 18:3 When wickedness comes, contempt also comes, and with shame comes disgrace. 18:4 The words of a man's mouth are like deep waters. The fountain of wisdom is like a flowing brook. 18:5 To be partial to the faces of the wicked is not good, nor to deprive the innocent of justice. 18:6 A fool's lips come into strife, and his mouth invites beatings. 18:7 A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are a snare to his soul. 18:8 The words of a gossip are like dainty morsels: they go down into a person's innermost parts. 18:9 One who is slack in his work is brother to him who is a master of destruction. 18:10 The name of Yahweh is a strong tower: the righteous run to him, and are safe. 18:11 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, like an unscalable wall in his own imagination. 18:12 Before destruction the heart of man is proud, but before honor is humility. 18:13 He who gives answer before he hears, that is folly and shame to him. 18:14 A man's spirit will sustain him in sickness, but a crushed spirit, who can bear? 18:15 The heart of the discerning gets knowledge. The ear of the wise seeks knowledge. 18:16 A man's gift makes room for him, and brings him before great men. 18:17 He who pleads his cause first seems right; until another comes and questions him. 18:18 The lot settles disputes, and keeps strong ones apart. 18:19 A brother offended is more difficult than a fortified city; and disputes are like the bars of a castle. 18:20 A man's stomach is filled with the fruit of his mouth. With the harvest of his lips he is satisfied. 18:21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue; those who love it will eat its fruit. 18:22 Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing, and obtains favor of Yahweh. 18:23 The poor plead for mercy, but the rich answer harshly. 18:24 A man of many companions may be ruined, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.
