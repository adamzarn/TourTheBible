A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger. 15:2 The tongue of the wise commends knowledge, but the mouth of fools gush out folly. 15:3 Yahweh's eyes are everywhere, keeping watch on the evil and the good. 15:4 A gentle tongue is a tree of life, but deceit in it crushes the spirit. 15:5 A fool despises his father's correction, but he who heeds reproof shows prudence. 15:6 In the house of the righteous is much treasure, but the income of the wicked brings trouble. 15:7 The lips of the wise spread knowledge; not so with the heart of fools. 15:8 The sacrifice made by the wicked is an abomination to Yahweh, but the prayer of the upright is his delight. 15:9 The way of the wicked is an abomination to Yahweh, but he loves him who follows after righteousness. 15:10 There is stern discipline for one who forsakes the way: whoever hates reproof shall die. 15:11 Sheol and Abaddon are before Yahweh--how much more then the hearts of the children of men! 15:12 A scoffer doesn't love to be reproved; he will not go to the wise. 15:13 A glad heart makes a cheerful face; but an aching heart breaks the spirit. 15:14 The heart of one who has understanding seeks knowledge, but the mouths of fools feed on folly. 15:15 All the days of the afflicted are wretched, but one who has a cheerful heart enjoys a continual feast. 15:16 Better is little, with the fear of Yahweh, than great treasure with trouble. 15:17 Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is, than a fattened calf with hatred. 15:18 A wrathful man stirs up contention, but one who is slow to anger appeases strife. 15:19 The way of the sluggard is like a thorn patch, but the path of the upright is a highway. 15:20 A wise son makes a father glad, but a foolish man despises his mother. 15:21 Folly is joy to one who is void of wisdom, but a man of understanding keeps his way straight. 15:22 Where there is no counsel, plans fail; but in a multitude of counselors they are established. 15:23 Joy comes to a man with the reply of his mouth. How good is a word at the right time! 15:24 The path of life leads upward for the wise, to keep him from going downward to Sheol. 15:25 Yahweh will uproot the house of the proud, but he will keep the widow's borders intact. 15:26 Yahweh detests the thoughts of the wicked, but the thoughts of the pure are pleasing. 15:27 He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house, but he who hates bribes will live. 15:28 The heart of the righteous weighs answers, but the mouth of the wicked gushes out evil. 15:29 Yahweh is far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer of the righteous. 15:30 The light of the eyes rejoices the heart. Good news gives health to the bones. 15:31 The ear that listens to reproof lives, and will be at home among the wise. 15:32 He who refuses correction despises his own soul, but he who listens to reproof gets understanding. 15:33 The fear of Yahweh teaches wisdom. Before honor is humility.
