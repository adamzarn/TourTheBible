The words of king Lemuel; the oracle which his mother taught him. 31:2 "Oh, my son! Oh, son of my womb! Oh, son of my vows! 31:3 Don't give your strength to women, nor your ways to that which destroys kings. 31:4 It is not for kings, Lemuel; it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes to say, 'Where is strong drink?' 31:5 lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted. 31:6 Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish; and wine to the bitter in soul: 31:7 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. 31:8 Open your mouth for the mute, in the cause of all who are left desolate. 31:9 Open your mouth, judge righteously, and serve justice to the poor and needy." 31:10 Who can find a worthy woman? For her price is far above rubies. 31:11 The heart of her husband trusts in her. He shall have no lack of gain. 31:12 She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life. 31:13 She seeks wool and flax, and works eagerly with her hands. 31:14 She is like the merchant ships. She brings her bread from afar. 31:15 She rises also while it is yet night, gives food to her household, and portions for her servant girls. 31:16 She considers a field, and buys it. With the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard. 31:17 She girds her waist with strength, and makes her arms strong. 31:18 She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp doesn't go out by night. 31:19 She lays her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle. 31:20 She opens her arms to the poor; yes, she extends her hands to the needy. 31:21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household; for all her household are clothed with scarlet. 31:22 She makes for herself carpets of tapestry. Her clothing is fine linen and purple. 31:23 Her husband is respected in the gates, when he sits among the elders of the land. 31:24 She makes linen garments and sells them, and delivers sashes to the merchant. 31:25 Strength and dignity are her clothing. She laughs at the time to come. 31:26 She opens her mouth with wisdom. Faithful instruction is on her tongue. 31:27 She looks well to the ways of her household, and doesn't eat the bread of idleness. 31:28 Her children rise up and call her blessed. Her husband also praises her: 31:29 "Many women do noble things, but you excel them all." 31:30 Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain; but a woman who fears Yahweh, she shall be praised. 31:31 Give her of the fruit of her hands! Let her works praise her in the gates!
