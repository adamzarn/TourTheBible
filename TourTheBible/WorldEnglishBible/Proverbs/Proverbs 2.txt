My son, if you will receive my words, and store up my commandments within you; 2:2 So as to turn your ear to wisdom, and apply your heart to understanding; 2:3 Yes, if you call out for discernment, and lift up your voice for understanding; 2:4 If you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures: 2:5 then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, and find the knowledge of God. 2:6 For Yahweh gives wisdom. Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding. 2:7 He lays up sound wisdom for the upright. He is a shield to those who walk in integrity; 2:8 that he may guard the paths of justice, and preserve the way of his saints. 2:9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, equity and every good path. 2:10 For wisdom will enter into your heart. Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. 2:11 Discretion will watch over you. Understanding will keep you, 2:12 to deliver you from the way of evil, from the men who speak perverse things; 2:13 who forsake the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; 2:14 who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perverseness of evil; 2:15 who are crooked in their ways, and wayward in their paths: 2:16 To deliver you from the strange woman, even from the foreigner who flatters with her words; 2:17 who forsakes the friend of her youth, and forgets the covenant of her God: 2:18 for her house leads down to death, her paths to the dead. 2:19 None who go to her return again, neither do they attain to the paths of life: 2:20 that you may walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. 2:21 For the upright will dwell in the land. The perfect will remain in it. 2:22 But the wicked will be cut off from the land. The treacherous will be rooted out of it.
