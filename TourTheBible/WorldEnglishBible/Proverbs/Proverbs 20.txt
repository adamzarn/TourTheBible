Wine is a mocker, and beer is a brawler. Whoever is led astray by them is not wise. 20:2 The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion. He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life. 20:3 It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife; but every fool will be quarreling. 20:4 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter; therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing. 20:5 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out. 20:6 Many men claim to be men of unfailing love, but who can find a faithful man? 20:7 A righteous man walks in integrity. Blessed are his children after him. 20:8 A king who sits on the throne of judgment scatters away all evil with his eyes. 20:9 Who can say, "I have made my heart pure. I am clean and without sin?" 20:10 Differing weights and differing measures, both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh. 20:11 Even a child makes himself known by his doings, whether his work is pure, and whether it is right. 20:12 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, Yahweh has made even both of them. 20:13 Don't love sleep, lest you come to poverty. Open your eyes, and you shall be satisfied with bread. 20:14 "It's no good, it's no good," says the buyer; but when he is gone his way, then he boasts. 20:15 There is gold and abundance of rubies; but the lips of knowledge are a rare jewel. 20:16 Take the garment of one who puts up collateral for a stranger; and hold him in pledge for a wayward woman. 20:17 Fraudulent food is sweet to a man, but afterwards his mouth is filled with gravel. 20:18 Plans are established by advice; by wise guidance you wage war! 20:19 He who goes about as a tale-bearer reveals secrets; therefore don't keep company with him who opens wide his lips. 20:20 Whoever curses his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness. 20:21 An inheritance quickly gained at the beginning, won't be blessed in the end. 20:22 Don't say, "I will pay back evil." Wait for Yahweh, and he will save you. 20:23 Yahweh detests differing weights, and dishonest scales are not pleasing. 20:24 A man's steps are from Yahweh; how then can man understand his way? 20:25 It is a snare to a man to make a rash dedication, then later to consider his vows. 20:26 A wise king winnows out the wicked, and drives the threshing wheel over them. 20:27 The spirit of man is Yahweh's lamp, searching all his innermost parts. 20:28 Love and faithfulness keep the king safe. His throne is sustained by love. 20:29 The glory of young men is their strength. The splendor of old men is their gray hair. 20:30 Wounding blows cleanse away evil, and beatings purge the innermost parts.
