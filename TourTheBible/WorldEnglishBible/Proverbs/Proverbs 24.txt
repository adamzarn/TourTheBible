Don't be envious of evil men; neither desire to be with them: 24:2 for their hearts plot violence, and their lips talk about mischief. 24:3 Through wisdom a house is built; by understanding it is established; 24:4 by knowledge the rooms are filled with all rare and beautiful treasure. 24:5 A wise man has great power; and a knowledgeable man increases strength; 24:6 for by wise guidance you wage your war; and victory is in many advisors. 24:7 Wisdom is too high for a fool: he doesn't open his mouth in the gate. 24:8 One who plots to do evil will be called a schemer. 24:9 The schemes of folly are sin. The mocker is detested by men. 24:10 If you falter in the time of trouble, your strength is small. 24:11 Rescue those who are being led away to death! Indeed, hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter! 24:12 If you say, "Behold, we didn't know this;" doesn't he who weighs the hearts consider it? He who keeps your soul, doesn't he know it? Shall he not render to every man according to his work? 24:13 My son, eat honey, for it is good; the droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste: 24:14 so you shall know wisdom to be to your soul; if you have found it, then there will be a reward, your hope will not be cut off. 24:15 Don't lay in wait, wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous. Don't destroy his resting place: 24:16 for a righteous man falls seven times, and rises up again; but the wicked are overthrown by calamity. 24:17 Don't rejoice when your enemy falls. Don't let your heart be glad when he is overthrown; 24:18 lest Yahweh see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him. 24:19 Don't fret yourself because of evildoers; neither be envious of the wicked: 24:20 for there will be no reward to the evil man; and the lamp of the wicked shall be snuffed out. 24:21 My son, fear Yahweh and the king. Don't join those who are rebellious: 24:22 for their calamity will rise suddenly; the destruction from them both--who knows? 24:23 These also are sayings of the wise. To show partiality in judgment is not good. 24:24 He who says to the wicked, "You are righteous;" peoples shall curse him, and nations shall abhor him-- 24:25 but it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and a rich blessing will come on them. 24:26 An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips. 24:27 Prepare your work outside, and get your fields ready. Afterwards, build your house. 24:28 Don't be a witness against your neighbor without cause. Don't deceive with your lips. 24:29 Don't say, "I will do to him as he has done to me; I will render to the man according to his work." 24:30 I went by the field of the sluggard, by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; 24:31 Behold, it was all grown over with thorns. Its surface was covered with nettles, and its stone wall was broken down. 24:32 Then I saw, and considered well. I saw, and received instruction: 24:33 a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep; 24:34 so shall your poverty come as a robber, and your want as an armed man.
