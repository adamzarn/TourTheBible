Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house. 14:2 David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israel's sake. 14:3 David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David became the father of more sons and daughters. 14:4 These are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, 14:5 and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet, 14:6 and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 14:7 and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet. 14:8 When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them. 14:9 Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim. 14:10 David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and will you deliver them into my hand? Yahweh said to him, Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand. 14:11 So they came up to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim. 14:12 They left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire. 14:13 The Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley. 14:14 David inquired again of God; and God said to him, You shall not go up after them: turn away from them, and come on them over against the mulberry trees. 14:15 It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall go out to battle; for God is gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines. 14:16 David did as God commanded him: and they struck the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer. 14:17 The fame of David went out into all lands; and Yahweh brought the fear of him on all nations.
