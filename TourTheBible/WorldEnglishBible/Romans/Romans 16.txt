I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is a servant of the assembly that is at Cenchreae, 16:2 that you receive her in the Lord, in a way worthy of the saints, and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you, for she herself also has been a helper of many, and of my own self. 16:3 Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, 16:4 who for my life, laid down their own necks; to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the assemblies of the Gentiles. 16:5 Greet the assembly that is in their house. Greet Epaenetus, my beloved, who is the first fruits of Achaia to Christ. 16:6 Greet Mary, who labored much for us. 16:7 Greet Andronicus and Junias, my relatives and my fellow prisoners, who are notable among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me. 16:8 Greet Amplias, my beloved in the Lord. 16:9 Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved. 16:10 Greet Apelles, the approved in Christ. Greet those who are of the household of Aristobulus. 16:11 Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet them of the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord. 16:12 Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Greet Persis, the beloved, who labored much in the Lord. 16:13 Greet Rufus, the chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine. 16:14 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers who are with them. 16:15 Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them. 16:16 Greet one another with a holy kiss. The assemblies of Christ greet you. 16:17 Now I beg you, brothers, look out for those who are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the doctrine which you learned, and turn away from them. 16:18 For those who are such don't serve our Lord, Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by their smooth and flattering speech, they deceive the hearts of the innocent. 16:19 For your obedience has become known to all. I rejoice therefore over you. But I desire to have you wise in that which is good, but innocent in that which is evil. 16:20 And the God of peace will quickly crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 16:21 Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you, as do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my relatives. 16:22 I, Tertius, who write the letter, greet you in the Lord. 16:23 Gaius, my host and host of the whole assembly, greets you. Erastus, the treasurer of the city, greets you, as does Quartus, the brother. 16:24 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all! Amen. 16:25  16:26  16:27
