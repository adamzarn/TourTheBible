I am the man that has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. 3:2 He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light. 3:3 Surely against me he turns his hand again and again all the day. 3:4 My flesh and my skin has he made old; he has broken my bones. 3:5 He has built against me, and compassed me with gall and travail. 3:6 He has made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead. 3:7 He has walled me about, that I can't go forth; he has made my chain heavy. 3:8 Yes, when I cry, and call for help, he shuts out my prayer. 3:9 He has walled up my ways with hewn stone; he has made my paths crooked. 3:10 He is to me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places. 3:11 He has turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he has made me desolate. 3:12 He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. 3:13 He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys. 3:14 I am become a derision to all my people, and their song all the day. 3:15 He has filled me with bitterness, he has sated me with wormwood. 3:16 He has also broken my teeth with gravel stones; he has covered me with ashes. 3:17 You have removed my soul far off from peace; I forgot prosperity. 3:18 I said, My strength is perished, and my expectation from Yahweh. 3:19 Remember my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. 3:20 My soul still remembers them, and is bowed down within me. 3:21 This I recall to my mind; therefore have I hope. 3:22 [It is of] Yahweh's loving kindnesses that we are not consumed, because his compassion doesn't fail. 3:23 They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness. 3:24 Yahweh is my portion, says my soul; therefore will I hope in him. 3:25 Yahweh is good to those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him. 3:26 It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh. 3:27 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. 3:28 Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he has laid it on him. 3:29 Let him put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope. 3:30 Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him; let him be filled full with reproach. 3:31 For the Lord will not cast off forever. 3:32 For though he cause grief, yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses. 3:33 For he does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men. 3:34 To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth, 3:35 To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High, 3:36 To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord doesn't approve. 3:37 Who is he who says, and it comes to pass, when the Lord doesn't command it? 3:38 Doesn't evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High? 3:39 Why does a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? 3:40 Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Yahweh. 3:41 Let us lift up our heart with our hands to God in the heavens. 3:42 We have transgressed and have rebelled; you have not pardoned. 3:43 You have covered with anger and pursued us; you have killed, you have not pitied. 3:44 You have covered yourself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through. 3:45 You have made us an off-scouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples. 3:46 All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us. 3:47 Fear and the pit are come on us, devastation and destruction. 3:48 My eye runs down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people. 3:49 My eye pours down, and doesn't cease, without any intermission, 3:50 Until Yahweh look down, and see from heaven. 3:51 My eye affects my soul, because of all the daughters of my city. 3:52 They have chased me sore like a bird, those who are my enemies without cause. 3:53 They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone on me. 3:54 Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off. 3:55 I called on your name, Yahweh, out of the lowest dungeon. 3:56 You heard my voice; don't hide your ear at my breathing, at my cry. 3:57 You drew near in the day that I called on you; you said, Don't be afraid. 3:58 Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul; you have redeemed my life. 3:59 Yahweh, you have seen my wrong; judge you my cause. 3:60 You have seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me. 3:61 You have heard their reproach, Yahweh, and all their devices against me, 3:62 The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day. 3:63 See you their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song. 3:64 You will render to them a recompense, Yahweh, according to the work of their hands. 3:65 You will give them hardness of heart, your curse to them. 3:66 You will pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Yahweh.
