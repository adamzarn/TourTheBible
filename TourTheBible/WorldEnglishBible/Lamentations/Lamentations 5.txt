Remember, Yahweh, what has come on us: Look, and see our reproach. 5:2 Our inheritance is turned to strangers, Our houses to aliens. 5:3 We are orphans and fatherless; Our mothers are as widows. 5:4 We have drunken our water for money; Our wood is sold to us. 5:5 Our pursuers are on our necks: We are weary, and have no rest. 5:6 We have given the hand to the Egyptians, To the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. 5:7 Our fathers sinned, and are no more; We have borne their iniquities. 5:8 Servants rule over us: There is none to deliver us out of their hand. 5:9 We get our bread at the peril of our lives, Because of the sword of the wilderness. 5:10 Our skin is black like an oven, Because of the burning heat of famine. 5:11 They ravished the women in Zion, The virgins in the cities of Judah. 5:12 Princes were hanged up by their hand: The faces of elders were not honored. 5:13 The young men bare the mill; The children stumbled under the wood. 5:14 The elders have ceased from the gate, The young men from their music. 5:15 The joy of our heart is ceased; Our dance is turned into mourning. 5:16 The crown is fallen from our head: Woe to us! for we have sinned. 5:17 For this our heart is faint; For these things our eyes are dim; 5:18 For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate: The foxes walk on it. 5:19 You, Yahweh, abide forever; Your throne is from generation to generation. 5:20 Why do you forget us forever, [And] forsake us so long time? 5:21 Turn you us to you, Yahweh, and we shall be turned; Renew our days as of old. 5:22 But you have utterly rejected us; You are very angry against us.
