1:1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus, 1:2 to Timothy, my beloved child:  Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 1:3 I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience.  How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day 1:4 longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy; 1:5 having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also. 1:6 For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. 1:7 For God didn't give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control. 1:8 Therefore don't be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God, 1:9 who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, 1:10 but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News. 1:11 For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. 1:12 For this cause I also suffer these things.  Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day. 1:13 Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 1:14 That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. 1:15 This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. 1:16 May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain, 1:17 but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me 1:18 (the Lord grant to him to find the Lord's mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well. 2:1 You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 2:2 The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also. 2:3 You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 2:4 No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier. 2:5 Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn't crowned unless he has competed by the rules. 2:6 The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops. 2:7 Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things. 2:8 Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my Good News, 2:9 in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God's word isn't chained. 2:10 Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones' sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 2:11 This saying is faithful:  "For if we died with him, we will also live with him. 2:12 If we endure, we will also reign with him.  If we deny him, he also will deny us. 2:13 If we are faithless, he remains faithful.  He can't deny himself." 2:14 Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don't argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear. 2:15 Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn't need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth. 2:16 But shun empty chatter, for they will proceed further in ungodliness, 2:17 and their word will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; 2:18 men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some. 2:19 However God's firm foundation stands, having this seal, "The Lord knows those who are his,"{Numbers 16:5} and, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord{TR reads "Christ" instead of "the Lord"} depart from unrighteousness." 2:20 Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay.  Some are for honor, and some for dishonor. 2:21 If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master's use, prepared for every good work. 2:22 Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 2:23 But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife. 2:24 The Lord's servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient, 2:25 in gentleness correcting those who oppose him:  perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth, 2:26 and they may recover themselves out of the devil's snare, having been taken captive by him to his will. 3:1 But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come. 3:2 For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3:3 without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good, 3:4 traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; 3:5 holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof. Turn away from these, also. 3:6 For of these are those who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, 3:7 always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 3:8 Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith. 3:9 But they will proceed no further.  For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be. 3:10 But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness, 3:11 persecutions, and sufferings:  those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra.  I endured those persecutions. Out of them all the Lord delivered me. 3:12 Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. 3:13 But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. 3:14 But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them. 3:15 From infancy, you have known the sacred writings which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus. 3:16 Every writing inspired by God{literally, God-breathed} is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction which is in righteousness, 3:17 that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. 4:1 I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom: 4:2 preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching. 4:3 For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts; 4:4 and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables. 4:5 But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry. 4:6 For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come. 4:7 I have fought the good fight.  I have finished the course. I have kept the faith. 4:8 From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing. 4:9 Be diligent to come to me soon, 4:10 for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. 4:11 Only Luke is with me.  Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service. 4:12 But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. 4:13 Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments. 4:14 Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works, 4:15 of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words. 4:16 At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them. 4:17 But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. 4:18 And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever.  Amen. 4:19 Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus. 4:20 Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick. 4:21 Be diligent to come before winter.  Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers. 4:22 The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.  Grace be with you.  Amen.
