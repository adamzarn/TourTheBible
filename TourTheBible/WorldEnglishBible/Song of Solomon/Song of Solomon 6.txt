Where has your beloved gone, you fairest among women? Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you? Beloved 6:2 My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. 6:3 I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine. He browses among the lilies, 6:4 You are beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, lovely as Jerusalem, awesome as an army with banners. 6:5 Turn away your eyes from me, for they have overcome me. Your hair is like a flock of goats, that lie along the side of Gilead. 6:6 Your teeth are like a flock of ewes, which have come up from the washing; of which every one has twins; none is bereaved among them. 6:7 Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil. 6:8 There are sixty queens, eighty concubines, and virgins without number. 6:9 My dove, my perfect one, is unique. She is her mother's only daughter. She is the favorite one of her who bore her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; the queens and the concubines, and they praised her. 6:10 Who is she who looks forth as the morning, beautiful as the moon, clear as the sun, and awesome as an army with banners? 6:11 I went down into the nut tree grove, to see the green plants of the valley, to see whether the vine budded, and the pomegranates were in flower. 6:12 Without realizing it, my desire set me with my royal people's chariots. Friends 6:13 Return, return, Shulammite! Return, return, that we may gaze at you. Lover Why do you desire to gaze at the Shulammite, as at the dance of Mahanaim?
