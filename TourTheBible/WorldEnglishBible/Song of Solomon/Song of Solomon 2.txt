I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys. Lover 2:2 As a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. Beloved 2:3 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, his fruit was sweet to my taste. 2:4 He brought me to the banquet hall. His banner over me is love. 2:5 Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with apples; For I am faint with love. 2:6 His left hand is under my head. His right hand embraces me. 2:7 I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, that you not stir up, nor awaken love, until it so desires. 2:8 The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes, leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills. 2:9 My beloved is like a roe or a young hart. Behold, he stands behind our wall! He looks in at the windows. He glances through the lattice. 2:10 My beloved spoke, and said to me, "Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away. 2:11 For, behold, the winter is past. The rain is over and gone. 2:12 The flowers appear on the earth. The time of the singing has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. 2:13 The fig tree ripens her green figs. The vines are in blossom. They give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away." Lover 2:14 My dove in the clefts of the rock, In the hiding places of the mountainside, Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely. 2:15 Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vineyards; for our vineyards are in blossom. Beloved 2:16 My beloved is mine, and I am his. He browses among the lilies. 2:17 Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be like a roe or a young hart on the mountains of Bether.
