Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, 3:2 to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men. 3:3 For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. 3:4 But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared, 3:5 not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, 3:6 whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior; 3:7 that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 3:8 This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men; 3:9 but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. 3:10 Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning; 3:11 knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned. 3:12 When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there. 3:13 Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them. 3:14 Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful. 3:15 All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
