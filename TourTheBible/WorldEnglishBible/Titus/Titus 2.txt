But say the things which fit sound doctrine, 2:2 that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in patience: 2:3 and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good; 2:4 that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, 2:5 to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God's word may not be blasphemed. 2:6 Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded; 2:7 in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility, 2:8 and soundness of speech that can't be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us. 2:9 Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting; 2:10 not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things. 2:11 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, 2:12 instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world; 2:13 looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ; 2:14 who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works. 2:15 Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you.
