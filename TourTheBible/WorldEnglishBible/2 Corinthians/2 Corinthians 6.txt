Working together, we entreat also that you not receive the grace of God in vain, 6:2 for he says, "At an acceptable time I listened to you, in a day of salvation I helped you." Behold, now is the acceptable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation. 6:3 We give no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our service may not be blamed, 6:4 but in everything commending ourselves, as servants of God, in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses, 6:5 in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings; 6:6 in pureness, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love, 6:7 in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, 6:8 by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true; 6:9 as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and not killed; 6:10 as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things. 6:11 Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians. Our heart is enlarged. 6:12 You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections. 6:13 Now in return, I speak as to my children, you also be open wide. 6:14 Don't be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? Or what communion has light with darkness? 6:15 What agreement has Christ with Belial? Or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever? 6:16 What agreement has a temple of God with idols? For you are a temple of the living God. Even as God said, "I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people." 6:17 Therefore, "'Come out from among them, and be separate,' says the Lord. 'Touch no unclean thing. I will receive you. 6:18 I will be to you a Father. You will be to me sons and daughters,' says the Lord Almighty."
