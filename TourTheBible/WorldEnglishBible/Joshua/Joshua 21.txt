and they possessed it, and lived therein. 21:44 Yahweh gave them rest round about, according to all that he swore to their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; Yahweh delivered all their enemies into their hand. 21:45 There failed not anything of any good thing which Yahweh had spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass.
