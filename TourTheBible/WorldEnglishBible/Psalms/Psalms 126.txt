<<A Song of Ascents.>> When Yahweh brought back those who returned to Zion, we were like those who dream. 126:2 Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing. Then they said among the nations, "Yahweh has done great things for them." 126:3 Yahweh has done great things for us, and we are glad. 126:4 Restore our fortunes again, Yahweh, like the streams in the Negev. 126:5 Those who sow in tears will reap in joy. 126:6 He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing, will certainly come again with joy, carrying his sheaves.
