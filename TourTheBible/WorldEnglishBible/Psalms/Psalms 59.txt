<<For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Do Not Destroy." A poem by David, when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.>> Deliver me from my enemies, my God. Set me on high from those who rise up against me. 59:2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity. Save me from the bloodthirsty men. 59:3 For, behold, they lie in wait for my soul. The mighty gather themselves together against me, not for my disobedience, nor for my sin, Yahweh. 59:4 I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me. Rise up, behold, and help me! 59:5 You, Yahweh God of Armies, the God of Israel, rouse yourself to punish the nations. Show no mercy to the wicked traitors. Selah. 59:6 They return at evening, howling like dogs, and prowl around the city. 59:7 Behold, they spew with their mouth. Swords are in their lips, "For," they say, "who hears us?" 59:8 But you, Yahweh, laugh at them. You scoff at all the nations. 59:9 Oh, my Strength, I watch for you, for God is my high tower. 59:10 My God will go before me with his loving kindness. God will let me look at my enemies in triumph. 59:11 Don't kill them, or my people may forget. Scatter them by your power, and bring them down, Lord our shield. 59:12 For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride, for the curses and lies which they utter. 59:13 Consume them in wrath. Consume them, and they will be no more. Let them know that God rules in Jacob, to the ends of the earth. Selah. 59:14 At evening let them return. Let them howl like a dog, and go around the city. 59:15 They shall wander up and down for food, and wait all night if they aren't satisfied. 59:16 But I will sing of your strength. Yes, I will sing aloud of your loving kindness in the morning. For you have been my high tower, a refuge in the day of my distress. 59:17 To you, my strength, I will sing praises. For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.
