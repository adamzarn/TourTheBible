Praise Yahweh! Sing to Yahweh a new song, his praise in the assembly of the saints. 149:2 Let Israel rejoice in him who made them. Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. 149:3 Let them praise his name in the dance! Let them sing praises to him with tambourine and harp! 149:4 For Yahweh takes pleasure in his people. He crowns the humble with salvation. 149:5 Let the saints rejoice in honor. Let them sing for joy on their beds. 149:6 May the high praises of God be in their mouths, and a two-edged sword in their hand; 149:7 To execute vengeance on the nations, and punishments on the peoples; 149:8 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; 149:9 to execute on them the written judgment. All his saints have this honor. Praise Yah!
