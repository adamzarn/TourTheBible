<<For the Chief Musician. On an instrument of Gath. By Asaph.>> Sing aloud to God, our strength! Make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob! 81:2 Raise a song, and bring here the tambourine, the pleasant lyre with the harp. 81:3 Blow the trumpet at the New Moon, at the full moon, on our feast day. 81:4 For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob. 81:5 He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out over the land of Egypt, I heard a language that I didn't know. 81:6 "I removed his shoulder from the burden. His hands were freed from the basket. 81:7 You called in trouble, and I delivered you. I answered you in the secret place of thunder. I tested you at the waters of Meribah." Selah. 81:8 "Hear, my people, and I will testify to you, Israel, if you would listen to me! 81:9 There shall be no strange god in you, neither shall you worship any foreign god. 81:10 I am Yahweh, your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it. 81:11 But my people didn't listen to my voice. Israel desired none of me. 81:12 So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts, that they might walk in their own counsels. 81:13 Oh that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk in my ways! 81:14 I would soon subdue their enemies, and turn my hand against their adversaries. 81:15 The haters of Yahweh would cringe before him, and their punishment would last forever. 81:16 But he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat. I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock."
