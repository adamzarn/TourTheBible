Give thanks to Yahweh! Call on his name! Make his doings known among the peoples. 105:2 Sing to him, sing praises to him! Tell of all his marvelous works. 105:3 Glory in his holy name. Let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice. 105:4 Seek Yahweh and his strength. Seek his face forever more. 105:5 Remember his marvelous works that he has done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth, 105:6 you seed of Abraham, his servant, you children of Jacob, his chosen ones. 105:7 He is Yahweh, our God. His judgments are in all the earth. 105:8 He has remembered his covenant forever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations, 105:9 the covenant which he made with Abraham, his oath to Isaac, 105:10 and confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute; to Israel for an everlasting covenant, 105:11 saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;" 105:12 when they were but a few men in number, yes, very few, and foreigners in it. 105:13 They went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people. 105:14 He allowed no one to do them wrong. Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes, 105:15 "Don't touch my anointed ones! Do my prophets no harm!" 105:16 He called for a famine on the land. He destroyed the food supplies. 105:17 He sent a man before them. Joseph was sold for a slave. 105:18 They bruised his feet with shackles. His neck was locked in irons, 105:19 until the time that his word happened, and Yahweh's word proved him true. 105:20 The king sent and freed him; even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free. 105:21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all of his possessions; 105:22 to discipline his princes at his pleasure, and to teach his elders wisdom. 105:23 Israel also came into Egypt. Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 105:24 He increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their adversaries. 105:25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to conspire against his servants. 105:26 He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen. 105:27 They performed miracles among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. 105:28 He sent darkness, and made it dark. They didn't rebel against his words. 105:29 He turned their waters into blood, and killed their fish. 105:30 Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings. 105:31 He spoke, and swarms of flies came, and lice in all their borders. 105:32 He gave them hail for rain, with lightning in their land. 105:33 He struck their vines and also their fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country. 105:34 He spoke, and the locusts came, and the grasshoppers, without number, 105:35 ate up every plant in their land; and ate up the fruit of their ground. 105:36 He struck also all the firstborn in their land, the first fruits of all their manhood. 105:37 He brought them forth with silver and gold. There was not one feeble person among his tribes. 105:38 Egypt was glad when they departed, for the fear of them had fallen on them. 105:39 He spread a cloud for a covering, fire to give light in the night. 105:40 They asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of the sky. 105:41 He opened the rock, and waters gushed out. They ran as a river in the dry places. 105:42 For he remembered his holy word, and Abraham, his servant. 105:43 He brought forth his people with joy, his chosen with singing. 105:44 He gave them the lands of the nations. They took the labor of the peoples in possession, 105:45 that they might keep his statutes, and observe his laws. Praise Yah!
