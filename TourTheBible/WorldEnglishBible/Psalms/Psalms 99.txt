Yahweh reigns! Let the peoples tremble. He sits enthroned among the cherubim. Let the earth be moved. 99:2 Yahweh is great in Zion. He is high above all the peoples. 99:3 Let them praise your great and awesome name. He is Holy! 99:4 The King's strength also loves justice. You do establish equity. You execute justice and righteousness in Jacob. 99:5 Exalt Yahweh our God. Worship at his footstool. He is Holy! 99:6 Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel among those who call on his name; they called on Yahweh, and he answered them. 99:7 He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud. They kept his testimonies, the statute that he gave them. 99:8 You answered them, Yahweh our God. You are a God who forgave them, although you took vengeance for their doings. 99:9 Exalt Yahweh, our God. Worship at his holy hill, for Yahweh, our God, is holy!
