<<For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.>> Hear my voice, God, in my complaint. Preserve my life from fear of the enemy. 64:2 Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from the noisy crowd of the ones doing evil; 64:3 who sharpen their tongue like a sword, and aim their arrows, deadly words, 64:4 to shoot innocent men from ambushes. They shoot at him suddenly and fearlessly. 64:5 They encourage themselves in evil plans. They talk about laying snares secretly. They say, "Who will see them?" 64:6 They plot injustice, saying, "We have made a perfect plan!" Surely man's mind and heart are cunning. 64:7 But God will shoot at them. They will be suddenly struck down with an arrow. 64:8 Their own tongues shall ruin them. All who see them will shake their heads. 64:9 All mankind shall be afraid. They shall declare the work of God, and shall wisely ponder what he has done. 64:10 The righteous shall be glad in Yahweh, and shall take refuge in him. All the upright in heart shall praise him!
