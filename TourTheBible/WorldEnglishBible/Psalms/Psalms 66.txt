<<For the Chief Musician. A song. A Psalm.>> Make a joyful shout to God, all the earth! 66:2 Sing to the glory of his name! Offer glory and praise! 66:3 Tell God, "How awesome are your deeds! Through the greatness of your power, your enemies submit themselves to you. 66:4 All the earth will worship you, and will sing to you; they will sing to your name." Selah. 66:5 Come, and see God's deeds--awesome work on behalf of the children of men. 66:6 He turned the sea into dry land. They went through the river on foot. There, we rejoiced in him. 66:7 He rules by his might forever. His eyes watch the nations. Don't let the rebellious rise up against him. Selah. 66:8 Praise our God, you peoples! Make the sound of his praise heard, 66:9 who preserves our life among the living, and doesn't allow our feet to be moved. 66:10 For you, God, have tested us. You have refined us, as silver is refined. 66:11 You brought us into prison. You laid a burden on our backs. 66:12 You allowed men to ride over our heads. We went through fire and through water, but you brought us to the place of abundance. 66:13 I will come into your temple with burnt offerings. I will pay my vows to you, 66:14 which my lips promised, and my mouth spoke, when I was in distress. 66:15 I will offer to you burnt offerings of fat animals, with the offering of rams, I will offer bulls with goats. Selah. 66:16 Come, and hear, all you who fear God. I will declare what he has done for my soul. 66:17 I cried to him with my mouth. He was extolled with my tongue. 66:18 If I cherished sin in my heart, the Lord wouldn't have listened. 66:19 But most certainly, God has listened. He has heard the voice of my prayer. 66:20 Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer, nor his loving kindness from me.
