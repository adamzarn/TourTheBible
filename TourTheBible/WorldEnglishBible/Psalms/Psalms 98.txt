<<A Psalm.>> Sing to Yahweh a new song, for he has done marvelous things! His right hand, and his holy arm, have worked salvation for him. 98:2 Yahweh has made known his salvation. He has openly shown his righteousness in the sight of the nations. 98:3 He has remembered his loving kindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 98:4 Make a joyful noise to Yahweh, all the earth! Burst out and sing for joy, yes, sing praises! 98:5 Sing praises to Yahweh with the harp, with the harp and the voice of melody. 98:6 With trumpets and sound of the ram's horn, make a joyful noise before the King, Yahweh. 98:7 Let the sea roar with its fullness; the world, and those who dwell therein. 98:8 Let the rivers clap their hands. Let the mountains sing for joy together. 98:9 Let them sing before Yahweh, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.
