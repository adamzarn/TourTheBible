<<For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.>> The heavens declare the glory of God. The expanse shows his handiwork. 19:2 Day after day they pour forth speech, and night after night they display knowledge. 19:3 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. 19:4 Their voice has gone out through all the earth, their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tent for the sun, 19:5 which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, like a strong man rejoicing to run his course. 19:6 His going forth is from the end of the heavens, his circuit to its ends; There is nothing hidden from its heat. 19:7 Yahweh's law is perfect, restoring the soul. Yahweh's testimony is sure, making wise the simple. 19:8 Yahweh's precepts are right, rejoicing the heart. Yahweh's commandment is pure, enlightening the eyes. 19:9 The fear of Yahweh is clean, enduring forever. Yahweh's ordinances are true, and righteous altogether. 19:10 More to be desired are they than gold, yes, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb. 19:11 Moreover by them is your servant warned. In keeping them there is great reward. 19:12 Who can discern his errors? Forgive me from hidden errors. 19:13 Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins. Let them not have dominion over me. Then I will be upright. I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression. 19:14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, Yahweh, my rock, and my redeemer.
