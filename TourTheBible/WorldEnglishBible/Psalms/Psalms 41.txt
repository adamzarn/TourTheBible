<<For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.>> Blessed is he who considers the poor. Yahweh will deliver him in the day of evil. 41:2 Yahweh will preserve him, and keep him alive. He shall be blessed on the earth, and he will not surrender him to the will of his enemies. 41:3 Yahweh will sustain him on his sickbed, and restore him from his bed of illness. 41:4 I said, "Yahweh, have mercy on me! Heal me, for I have sinned against you." 41:5 My enemies speak evil against me: "When will he die, and his name perish?" 41:6 If he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood. His heart gathers iniquity to itself. When he goes abroad, he tells it. 41:7 All who hate me whisper together against me. They imagine the worst for me. 41:8 "An evil disease," they say, "has afflicted him. Now that he lies he shall rise up no more." 41:9 Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who ate bread with me, has lifted up his heel against me. 41:10 But you, Yahweh, have mercy on me, and raise me up, that I may repay them. 41:11 By this I know that you delight in me, because my enemy doesn't triumph over me. 41:12 As for me, you uphold me in my integrity, and set me in your presence forever. 41:13 Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting! Amen and amen.
