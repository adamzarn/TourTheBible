<<A Song. A Psalm by David.>> My heart is steadfast, God. I will sing and I will make music with my soul. 108:2 Wake up, harp and lyre! I will wake up the dawn. 108:3 I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations. I will sing praises to you among the peoples. 108:4 For your loving kindness is great above the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the skies. 108:5 Be exalted, God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth. 108:6 That your beloved may be delivered, save with your right hand, and answer us. 108:7 God has spoken from his sanctuary: "In triumph, I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth. 108:8 Gilead is mine. Manasseh is mine. Ephraim also is my helmet. Judah is my scepter. 108:9 Moab is my wash pot. I will toss my sandal on Edom. I will shout over Philistia." 108:10 Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who has led me to Edom? 108:11 Haven't you rejected us, God? You don't go forth, God, with our armies. 108:12 Give us help against the enemy, for the help of man is vain. 108:13 Through God, we will do valiantly. For it is he who will tread down our enemies.
