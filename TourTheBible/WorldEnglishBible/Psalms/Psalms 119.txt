I promised to obey your words. 119:58 I sought your favor with my whole heart. Be merciful to me according to your word. 119:59 I considered my ways, and turned my steps to your statutes. 119:60 I will hurry, and not delay, to obey your commandments. 119:61 The ropes of the wicked bind me, but I won't forget your law. 119:62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks to you, because of your righteous ordinances. 119:63 I am a friend of all those who fear you, of those who observe your precepts. 119:64 The earth is full of your loving kindness, Yahweh.

Teach me your statutes. 119:69 The proud have smeared a lie upon me. With my whole heart, I will keep your precepts. 119:70 Their heart is as callous as the fat, but I delight in your law. 119:71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I may learn your statutes. 119:72 The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of pieces of gold and silver. 119:73 Your hands have made me and formed me. Give me understanding, that I may learn your commandments. 119:74 Those who fear you will see me and be glad, because I have put my hope in your word. 119:75 Yahweh, I know that your judgments are righteous, that in faithfulness you have afflicted me. 119:76 Please let your loving kindness be for my comfort, according to your word to your servant. 119:77 Let your tender mercies come to me, that I may live; for your law is my delight. 119:78 Let the proud be disappointed, for they have overthrown me wrongfully. I will meditate on your precepts. 119:79 Let those who fear you turn to me. They will know your statutes. 119:80 Let my heart be blameless toward your decrees, that I may not be disappointed. 119:81 My soul faints for your salvation. I hope in your word. 119:82 My eyes fail for your word. I say, "When will you comfort me?" 119:83 For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke. I don't forget your statutes. 119:84 How many are the days of your servant? When will you execute judgment on those who persecute me? 119:85 The proud have dug pits for me, contrary to your law. 119:86 All of your commandments are faithful. They persecute me wrongfully. Help me! 119:87 They had almost wiped me from the earth, but I didn't forsake your precepts. 119:88 Preserve my life according to your loving kindness, so I will obey the statutes of your mouth. 119:89 Yahweh, your word is settled in heaven forever. 119:90 Your faithfulness is to all generations. You have established the earth, and it remains. 119:91 Your laws remain to this day, for all things serve you. 119:92 Unless your law had been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction. 119:93 I will never forget your precepts, for with them, you have revived me. 119:94 I am yours. Save me, for I have sought your precepts. 119:95 The wicked have waited for me, to destroy me. I will consider your statutes. 119:96 I have seen a limit to all perfection, but your commands are boundless. 119:97 How I love your law! It is my meditation all day. 119:98 Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies, for your commandments are always with me. 119:99 I have more understanding than all my teachers, for your testimonies are my meditation. 119:100 I understand more than the aged, because I have kept your precepts. 119:101 I have kept my feet from every evil way, that I might observe your word. 119:102 I have not turned aside from your ordinances, for you have taught me. 119:103 How sweet are your promises to my taste, more than honey to my mouth! 119:104 Through your precepts, I get understanding; therefore I hate every false way. 119:105 Your word is a lamp to my feet, and a light for my path. 119:106 I have sworn, and have confirmed it, that I will obey your righteous ordinances. 119:107 I am afflicted very much. Revive me, Yahweh, according to your word. 119:108 Accept, I beg you, the willing offerings of my mouth. Yahweh, teach me your ordinances. 119:109 My soul is continually in my hand, yet I won't forget your law. 119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me, yet I haven't gone astray from your precepts. 119:111 I have taken your testimonies as a heritage forever, for they are the joy of my heart. 119:112 I have set my heart to perform your statutes forever, even to the end. 119:113 I hate double-minded men, but I love your law. 119:114 You are my hiding place and my shield. I hope in your word. 119:115 Depart from me, you evildoers, that I may keep the commandments of my God. 119:116 Uphold me according to your word, that I may live. Let me not be ashamed of my hope. 119:117 Hold me up, and I will be safe, and will have respect for your statutes continually. 119:118 You reject all those who stray from your statutes, for their deceit is in vain. 119:119 You put away all the wicked of the earth like dross. Therefore I love your testimonies. 119:120 My flesh trembles for fear of you. I am afraid of your judgments. 119:121 I have done what is just and righteous. Don't leave me to my oppressors. 119:122 Ensure your servant's well-being. Don't let the proud oppress me. 119:123 My eyes fail looking for your salvation, for your righteous word. 119:124 Deal with your servant according to your loving kindness. Teach me your statutes. 119:125 I am your servant. Give me understanding, that I may know your testimonies. 119:126 It is time to act, Yahweh, for they break your law. 119:127 Therefore I love your commandments more than gold, yes, more than pure gold. 119:128 Therefore I consider all of your precepts to be right. I hate every false way. 119:129 Your testimonies are wonderful, therefore my soul keeps them. 119:130 The entrance of your words gives light. It gives understanding to the simple. 119:131 I opened my mouth wide and panted, for I longed for your commandments. 119:132 Turn to me, and have mercy on me, as you always do to those who love your name. 119:133 Establish my footsteps in your word. Don't let any iniquity have dominion over me. 119:134 Redeem me from the oppression of man, so I will observe your precepts. 119:135 Make your face shine on your servant. Teach me your statutes. 119:136 Streams of tears run down my eyes, because they don't observe your law. 119:137 You are righteous, Yahweh. Your judgments are upright. 119:138 You have commanded your statutes in righteousness. They are fully trustworthy. 119:139 My zeal wears me out, because my enemies ignore your words. 119:140 Your promises have been thoroughly tested, and your servant loves them. 119:141 I am small and despised. I don't forget your precepts. 119:142 Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness. Your law is truth. 119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold of me. Your commandments are my delight. 119:144 Your testimonies are righteous forever. Give me understanding, that I may live. 119:145 I have called with my whole heart. Answer me, Yahweh! I will keep your statutes. 119:146 I have called to you. Save me! I will obey your statutes. 119:147 I rise before dawn and cry for help. I put my hope in your words. 119:148 My eyes stay open through the night watches, that I might meditate on your word. 119:149 Hear my voice according to your loving kindness. Revive me, Yahweh, according to your ordinances. 119:150 They draw near who follow after wickedness. They are far from your law. 119:151 You are near, Yahweh. All your commandments are truth. 119:152 Of old I have known from your testimonies, that you have founded them forever. 119:153 Consider my affliction, and deliver me, for I don't forget your law. 119:154 Plead my cause, and redeem me! Revive me according to your promise. 119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked, for they don't seek your statutes. 119:156 Great are your tender mercies, Yahweh.
