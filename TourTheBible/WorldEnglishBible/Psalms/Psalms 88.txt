<<A Song. A Psalm by the sons of Korah. For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "The Suffering of Affliction." A contemplation by Heman, the Ezrahite.>> Yahweh, the God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before you. 88:2 Let my prayer enter into your presence. Turn your ear to my cry. 88:3 For my soul is full of troubles. My life draws near to Sheol. 88:4 I am counted among those who go down into the pit. I am like a man who has no help, 88:5 set apart among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom you remember no more. They are cut off from your hand. 88:6 You have laid me in the lowest pit, in the darkest depths. 88:7 Your wrath lies heavily on me. You have afflicted me with all your waves. Selah. 88:8 You have taken my friends from me. You have made me an abomination to them. I am confined, and I can't escape. 88:9 My eyes are dim from grief. I have called on you daily, Yahweh. I have spread out my hands to you. 88:10 Do you show wonders to the dead? Do the dead rise up and praise you? Selah. 88:11 Is your loving kindness declared in the grave? Or your faithfulness in Destruction? 88:12 Are your wonders made known in the dark? Or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? 88:13 But to you, Yahweh, I have cried. In the morning, my prayer comes before you. 88:14 Yahweh, why do you reject my soul? Why do you hide your face from me? 88:15 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up. While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted. 88:16 Your fierce wrath has gone over me. Your terrors have cut me off. 88:17 They came around me like water all day long. They completely engulfed me. 88:18 You have put lover and friend far from me, and my friends into darkness.
