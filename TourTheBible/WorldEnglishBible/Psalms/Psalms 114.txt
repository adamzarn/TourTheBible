When Israel went forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of foreign language; 114:2 Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion. 114:3 The sea saw it, and fled. The Jordan was driven back. 114:4 The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs. 114:5 What was it, you sea, that you fled? You Jordan, that you turned back? 114:6 You mountains, that you skipped like rams; you little hills, like lambs? 114:7 Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob, 114:8 who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of waters.
