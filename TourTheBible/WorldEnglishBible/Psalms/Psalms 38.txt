<<A Psalm by David, for a memorial.>> Yahweh, don't rebuke me in your wrath, neither chasten me in your hot displeasure. 38:2 For your arrows have pierced me, your hand presses hard on me. 38:3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation, neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin. 38:4 For my iniquities have gone over my head. As a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me. 38:5 My wounds are loathsome and corrupt, because of my foolishness. 38:6 I am pained and bowed down greatly. I go mourning all day long. 38:7 For my waist is filled with burning. There is no soundness in my flesh. 38:8 I am faint and severely bruised. I have groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart. 38:9 Lord, all my desire is before you. My groaning is not hidden from you. 38:10 My heart throbs. My strength fails me. As for the light of my eyes, it has also left me. 38:11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague. My kinsmen stand far away. 38:12 They also who seek after my life lay snares. Those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and meditate deceits all day long. 38:13 But I, as a deaf man, don't hear. I am as a mute man who doesn't open his mouth. 38:14 Yes, I am as a man who doesn't hear, in whose mouth are no reproofs. 38:15 For in you, Yahweh, do I hope. You will answer, Lord my God. 38:16 For I said, "Don't let them gloat over me, or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips." 38:17 For I am ready to fall. My pain is continually before me. 38:18 For I will declare my iniquity. I will be sorry for my sin. 38:19 But my enemies are vigorous and many. Those who hate me without reason are numerous. 38:20 They who also render evil for good are adversaries to me, because I follow what is good. 38:21 Don't forsake me, Yahweh. My God, don't be far from me. 38:22 Hurry to help me, Lord, my salvation.
