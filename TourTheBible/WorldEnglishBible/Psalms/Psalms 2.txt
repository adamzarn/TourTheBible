Why do the nations rage, and the peoples plot a vain thing? 2:2 The kings of the earth take a stand, and the rulers take counsel together, against Yahweh, and against his Anointed, saying, 2:3 "Let's break their bonds apart, and cast their cords from us." 2:4 He who sits in the heavens will laugh. The Lord will have them in derision. 2:5 Then he will speak to them in his anger, and terrify them in his wrath: 2:6 "Yet I have set my king on my holy hill of Zion." 2:7 I will tell of the decree. Yahweh said to me, "You are my son. Today I have become your father. 2:8 Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance, the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession. 2:9 You shall break them with a rod of iron. You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel." 2:10 Now therefore be wise, you kings. Be instructed, you judges of the earth. 2:11 Serve Yahweh with fear, and rejoice with trembling. 2:12 Give sincere homage, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.
