<<A Poem by David.>> Preserve me, God, for in you do I take refuge. 16:2 My soul, you have said to Yahweh, "You are my Lord. Apart from you I have no good thing." 16:3 As for the saints who are in the earth, they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight. 16:4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god. Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, nor take their names on my lips. 16:5 Yahweh assigned my portion and my cup. You made my lot secure. 16:6 The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places. Yes, I have a good inheritance. 16:7 I will bless Yahweh, who has given me counsel. Yes, my heart instructs me in the night seasons. 16:8 I have set Yahweh always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. 16:9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoices. My body shall also dwell in safety. 16:10 For you will not leave my soul in Sheol, neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption. 16:11 You will show me the path of life. In your presence is fullness of joy. In your right hand there are pleasures forevermore.
