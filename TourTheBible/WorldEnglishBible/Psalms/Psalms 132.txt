<<A Song of Ascents.>> Yahweh, remember David and all his affliction, 132:2 how he swore to Yahweh, and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: 132:3 "Surely I will not come into the structure of my house, nor go up into my bed; 132:4 I will not give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids; 132:5 until I find out a place for Yahweh, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob." 132:6 Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah. We found it in the field of Jaar: 132:7 "We will go into his dwelling place. We will worship at his footstool. 132:8 Arise, Yahweh, into your resting place; you, and the ark of your strength. 132:9 Let your priest be clothed with righteousness. Let your saints shout for joy!" 132:10 For your servant David's sake, don't turn away the face of your anointed one. 132:11 Yahweh has sworn to David in truth. He will not turn from it: "I will set the fruit of your body on your throne. 132:12 If your children will keep my covenant, my testimony that I will teach them, their children also will sit on your throne forevermore." 132:13 For Yahweh has chosen Zion. He has desired it for his habitation. 132:14 "This is my resting place forever. Here I will live, for I have desired it. 132:15 I will abundantly bless her provision. I will satisfy her poor with bread. 132:16 Her priests I will also clothe with salvation. Her saints will shout aloud for joy. 132:17 There I will make the horn of David to bud. I have ordained a lamp for my anointed. 132:18 I will clothe his enemies with shame, but on himself, his crown will be resplendent."
