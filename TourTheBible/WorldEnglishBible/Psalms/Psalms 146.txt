Praise Yah! Praise Yahweh, my soul. 146:2 While I live, I will praise Yahweh. I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist. 146:3 Don't put your trust in princes, each a son of man in whom there is no help. 146:4 His spirit departs, and he returns to the earth. In that very day, his thoughts perish. 146:5 Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in Yahweh, his God: 146:6 who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them; who keeps truth forever; 146:7 who executes justice for the oppressed; who gives food to the hungry. Yahweh frees the prisoners. 146:8 Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind. Yahweh raises up those who are bowed down. Yahweh loves the righteous. 146:9 Yahweh preserves the foreigners. He upholds the fatherless and widow, but the way of the wicked he turns upside down. 146:10 Yahweh will reign forever; your God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise Yah!
