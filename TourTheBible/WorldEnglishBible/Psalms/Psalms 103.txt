<<By David.>> Praise Yahweh, my soul! All that is within me, praise his holy name! 103:2 Praise Yahweh, my soul, and don't forget all his benefits; 103:3 who forgives all your sins; who heals all your diseases; 103:4 who redeems your life from destruction; who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies; 103:5 who satisfies your desire with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's. 103:6 Yahweh executes righteous acts, and justice for all who are oppressed. 103:7 He made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the children of Israel. 103:8 Yahweh is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness. 103:9 He will not always accuse; neither will he stay angry forever. 103:10 He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor repaid us for our iniquities. 103:11 For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him. 103:12 As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us. 103:13 Like a father has compassion on his children, so Yahweh has compassion on those who fear him. 103:14 For he knows how we are made. He remembers that we are dust. 103:15 As for man, his days are like grass. As a flower of the field, so he flourishes. 103:16 For the wind passes over it, and it is gone. Its place remembers it no more. 103:17 But Yahweh's loving kindness is from everlasting to everlasting with those who fear him, his righteousness to children's children; 103:18 to those who keep his covenant, to those who remember to obey his precepts. 103:19 Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens. His kingdom rules over all. 103:20 Praise Yahweh, you angels of his, who are mighty in strength, who fulfill his word, obeying the voice of his word. 103:21 Praise Yahweh, all you armies of his, you servants of his, who do his pleasure. 103:22 Praise Yahweh, all you works of his, in all places of his dominion. Praise Yahweh, my soul!
