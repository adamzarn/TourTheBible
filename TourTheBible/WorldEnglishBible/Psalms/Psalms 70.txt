<<For the Chief Musician. By David. A reminder.>> Hurry, God, to deliver me. Come quickly to help me, Yahweh. 70:2 Let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul. Let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace. 70:3 Let them be turned because of their shame Who say, "Aha! Aha!" 70:4 Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. Let those who love your salvation continually say, "Let God be exalted!" 70:5 But I am poor and needy. Come to me quickly, God. You are my help and my deliverer. Yahweh, don't delay.
