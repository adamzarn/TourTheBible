<<A contemplation by Ethan, the Ezrahite.>> I will sing of the loving kindness of Yahweh forever. With my mouth, I will make known your faithfulness to all generations. 89:2 I indeed declare, "Love stands firm forever. You established the heavens. Your faithfulness is in them." 89:3 "I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn to David, my servant, 89:4 'I will establish your seed forever, and build up your throne to all generations.'" Selah. 89:5 The heavens will praise your wonders, Yahweh; your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones. 89:6 For who in the skies can be compared to Yahweh? Who among the sons of the heavenly beings is like Yahweh, 89:7 a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones, to be feared above all those who are around him? 89:8 Yahweh, God of Armies, who is a mighty one, like you? Yah, your faithfulness is around you. 89:9 You rule the pride of the sea. When its waves rise up, you calm them. 89:10 You have broken Rahab in pieces, like one of the slain. You have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm. 89:11 The heavens are yours. The earth also is yours; the world and its fullness. You have founded them. 89:12 The north and the south, you have created them. Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name. 89:13 You have a mighty arm. Your hand is strong, and your right hand is exalted. 89:14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne. Loving kindness and truth go before your face. 89:15 Blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you. They walk in the light of your presence, Yahweh. 89:16 In your name they rejoice all day. In your righteousness, they are exalted. 89:17 For you are the glory of their strength. In your favor, our horn will be exalted. 89:18 For our shield belongs to Yahweh; our king to the Holy One of Israel. 89:19 Then you spoke in vision to your saints, and said, "I have bestowed strength on the warrior. I have exalted a young man from the people. 89:20 I have found David, my servant. I have anointed him with my holy oil, 89:21 with whom my hand shall be established. My arm will also strengthen him. 89:22 No enemy will tax him. No wicked man will oppress him. 89:23 I will beat down his adversaries before him, and strike those who hate him. 89:24 But my faithfulness and my loving kindness will be with him. In my name, his horn will be exalted. 89:25 I will set his hand also on the sea, and his right hand on the rivers. 89:26 He will call to me, 'You are my Father, my God, and the rock of my salvation!' 89:27 I will also appoint him my firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth. 89:28 I will keep my loving kindness for him forevermore. My covenant will stand firm with him. 89:29 I will also make his seed endure forever, and his throne as the days of heaven. 89:30 If his children forsake my law, and don't walk in my ordinances; 89:31 if they break my statutes, and don't keep my commandments; 89:32 then I will punish their sin with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. 89:33 But I will not completely take my loving kindness from him, nor allow my faithfulness to fail. 89:34 I will not break my covenant, nor alter what my lips have uttered. 89:35 Once have I sworn by my holiness, I will not lie to David. 89:36 His seed will endure forever, his throne like the sun before me. 89:37 It will be established forever like the moon, the faithful witness in the sky." Selah. 89:38 But you have rejected and spurned. You have been angry with your anointed. 89:39 You have renounced the covenant of your servant. You have defiled his crown in the dust. 89:40 You have broken down all his hedges. You have brought his strongholds to ruin. 89:41 All who pass by the way rob him. He has become a reproach to his neighbors. 89:42 You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries. You have made all of his enemies rejoice. 89:43 Yes, you turn back the edge of his sword, and haven't supported him in battle. 89:44 You have ended his splendor, and thrown his throne down to the ground. 89:45 You have shortened the days of his youth. You have covered him with shame. Selah. 89:46 How long, Yahweh? Will you hide yourself forever? Will your wrath burn like fire? 89:47 Remember how short my time is! For what vanity have you created all the children of men! 89:48 What man is he who shall live and not see death, who shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah. 89:49 Lord, where are your former loving kindnesses, which you swore to David in your faithfulness? 89:50 Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants, how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the mighty peoples, 89:51 With which your enemies have mocked, Yahweh, with which they have mocked the footsteps of your anointed one. 89:52 Blessed be Yahweh forevermore. Amen, and Amen.
