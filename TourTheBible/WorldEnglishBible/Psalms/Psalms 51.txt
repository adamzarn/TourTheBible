<<For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.>> Have mercy on me, God, according to your loving kindness. According to the multitude of your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions. 51:2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity. Cleanse me from my sin. 51:3 For I know my transgressions. My sin is constantly before me. 51:4 Against you, and you only, have I sinned, and done that which is evil in your sight; that you may be proved right when you speak, and justified when you judge. 51:5 Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity. In sin my mother conceived me. 51:6 Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts. You teach me wisdom in the inmost place. 51:7 Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean. Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow. 51:8 Let me hear joy and gladness, That the bones which you have broken may rejoice. 51:9 Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all of my iniquities. 51:10 Create in me a clean heart, O God. Renew a right spirit within me. 51:11 Don't throw me from your presence, and don't take your holy Spirit from me. 51:12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation. Uphold me with a willing spirit. 51:13 Then I will teach transgressors your ways. Sinners shall be converted to you. 51:14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation. My tongue shall sing aloud of your righteousness. 51:15 Lord, open my lips. My mouth shall declare your praise. 51:16 For you don't delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it. You have no pleasure in burnt offering. 51:17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. A broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise. 51:18 Do well in your good pleasure to Zion. Build the walls of Jerusalem. 51:19 Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer bulls on your altar.
