<<A Psalm by David, when he was in the desert of Judah.>> God, you are my God. I will earnestly seek you. My soul thirsts for you. My flesh longs for you, in a dry and weary land, where there is no water. 63:2 So I have seen you in the sanctuary, watching your power and your glory. 63:3 Because your loving kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise you. 63:4 So I will bless you while I live. I will lift up my hands in your name. 63:5 My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food. My mouth shall praise you with joyful lips, 63:6 when I remember you on my bed, and think about you in the night watches. 63:7 For you have been my help. I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings. 63:8 My soul stays close to you. Your right hand holds me up. 63:9 But those who seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth. 63:10 They shall be given over to the power of the sword. They shall be jackal food. 63:11 But the king shall rejoice in God. Everyone who swears by him will praise him, for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be silenced.
