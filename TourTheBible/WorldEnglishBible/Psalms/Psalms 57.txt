<<For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Do Not Destroy." A poem by David, when he fled from Saul, in the cave.>> Be merciful to me, God, be merciful to me, for my soul takes refuge in you. Yes, in the shadow of your wings, I will take refuge, until disaster has passed. 57:2 I cry out to God Most High, to God who accomplishes my requests for me. 57:3 He will send from heaven, and save me, he rebukes the one who is pursuing me. Selah. God will send out his loving kindness and his truth. 57:4 My soul is among lions. I lie among those who are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword. 57:5 Be exalted, God, above the heavens! Let your glory be above all the earth! 57:6 They have prepared a net for my steps. My soul is bowed down. They dig a pit before me. They fall into the midst of it themselves. Selah. 57:7 My heart is steadfast, God, my heart is steadfast. I will sing, yes, I will sing praises. 57:8 Wake up, my glory! Wake up, psaltery and harp! I will wake up the dawn. 57:9 I will give thanks to you, Lord, among the peoples. I will sing praises to you among the nations. 57:10 For your great loving kindness reaches to the heavens, and your truth to the skies. 57:11 Be exalted, God, above the heavens. Let your glory be over all the earth.
