<<For the Chief Musician. By David.>> In Yahweh, I take refuge. How can you say to my soul, "Flee as a bird to your mountain!" 11:2 For, behold, the wicked bend their bows. They set their arrows on the strings, that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart. 11:3 If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do? 11:4 Yahweh is in his holy temple. Yahweh is on his throne in heaven. His eyes observe. His eyes examine the children of men. 11:5 Yahweh examines the righteous, but the wicked and him who loves violence his soul hates. 11:6 On the wicked he will rain blazing coals; fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup. 11:7 For Yahweh is righteous. He loves righteousness. The upright shall see his face.
