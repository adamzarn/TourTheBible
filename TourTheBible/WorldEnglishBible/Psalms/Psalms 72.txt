<<By Solomon.>> God, give the king your justice; your righteousness to the royal son. 72:2 He will judge your people with righteousness, and your poor with justice. 72:3 The mountains shall bring prosperity to the people. The hills bring the fruit of righteousness. 72:4 He will judge the poor of the people. He will save the children of the needy, and will break the oppressor in pieces. 72:5 They shall fear you while the sun endures; and as long as the moon, throughout all generations. 72:6 He will come down like rain on the mown grass, as showers that water the earth. 72:7 In his days, the righteous shall flourish, and abundance of peace, until the moon is no more. 72:8 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, from the River to the ends of the earth. 72:9 Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him. His enemies shall lick the dust. 72:10 The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring tribute. The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. 72:11 Yes, all kings shall fall down before him. All nations shall serve him. 72:12 For he will deliver the needy when he cries; the poor, who has no helper. 72:13 He will have pity on the poor and needy. He will save the souls of the needy. 72:14 He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence. Their blood will be precious in his sight. 72:15 They shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba. Men shall pray for him continually. They shall bless him all day long. 72:16 There shall be abundance of grain throughout the land. Its fruit sways like Lebanon. Let it flourish, thriving like the grass of the field. 72:17 His name endures forever. His name continues as long as the sun. Men shall be blessed by him. All nations will call him blessed. 72:18 Praise be to Yahweh God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds. 72:19 Blessed be his glorious name forever! Let the whole earth be filled with his glory! Amen and amen. 72:20 This ends the prayers by David, the son of Jesse.
