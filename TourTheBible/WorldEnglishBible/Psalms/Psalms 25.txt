<<By David.>> To you, Yahweh, do I lift up my soul. 25:2 My God, I have trusted in you. Don't let me be shamed. Don't let my enemies triumph over me. 25:3 Yes, no one who waits for you shall be shamed. They shall be shamed who deal treacherously without cause. 25:4 Show me your ways, Yahweh. Teach me your paths. 25:5 Guide me in your truth, and teach me, For you are the God of my salvation, I wait for you all day long. 25:6 Yahweh, remember your tender mercies and your loving kindness, for they are from old times. 25:7 Don't remember the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions. Remember me according to your loving kindness, for your goodness' sake, Yahweh. 25:8 Good and upright is Yahweh, therefore he will instruct sinners in the way. 25:9 He will guide the humble in justice. He will teach the humble his way. 25:10 All the paths of Yahweh are loving kindness and truth to such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. 25:11 For your name's sake, Yahweh, pardon my iniquity, for it is great. 25:12 What man is he who fears Yahweh? He shall instruct him in the way that he shall choose. 25:13 His soul shall dwell at ease. His seed shall inherit the land. 25:14 The friendship of Yahweh is with those who fear him. He will show them his covenant. 25:15 My eyes are ever on Yahweh, for he will pluck my feet out of the net. 25:16 Turn to me, and have mercy on me, for I am desolate and afflicted. 25:17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged. Oh bring me out of my distresses. 25:18 Consider my affliction and my travail. Forgive all my sins. 25:19 Consider my enemies, for they are many. They hate me with cruel hatred. 25:20 Oh keep my soul, and deliver me. Let me not be disappointed, for I take refuge in you. 25:21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait for you. 25:22 Redeem Israel, God, out all of his troubles.
