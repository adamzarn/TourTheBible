By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down. Yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion. 137:2 On the willows in the midst of it, we hung up our harps. 137:3 For there, those who led us captive asked us for songs. Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy: "Sing us one of the songs of Zion!" 137:4 How can we sing Yahweh's song in a foreign land? 137:5 If I forget you, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill. 137:6 Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don't remember you; if I don't prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy. 137:7 Remember, Yahweh, against the children of Edom, the day of Jerusalem; who said, "Raze it! Raze it even to its foundation!" 137:8 Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, he will be happy who rewards you, as you have served us. 137:9 Happy shall he be, who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock.
