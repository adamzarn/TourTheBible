<<A song. A Psalm by Asaph.>> God, don't keep silent. Don't keep silent, and don't be still, God. 83:2 For, behold, your enemies are stirred up. Those who hate you have lifted up their heads. 83:3 They conspire with cunning against your people. They plot against your cherished ones. 83:4 "Come," they say, "and let's destroy them as a nation, that the name of Israel may be remembered no more." 83:5 For they have conspired together with one mind. They form an alliance against you. 83:6 The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites; 83:7 Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre; 83:8 Assyria also is joined with them. They have helped the children of Lot. Selah. 83:9 Do to them as you did to Midian, as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon; 83:10 who perished at Endor, who became as dung for the earth. 83:11 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna; 83:12 who said, "Let us take possession of God's pasturelands." 83:13 My God, make them like tumbleweed; like chaff before the wind. 83:14 As the fire that burns the forest, as the flame that sets the mountains on fire, 83:15 so pursue them with your tempest, and terrify them with your storm. 83:16 Fill their faces with confusion, that they may seek your name, Yahweh. 83:17 Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever. Yes, let them be confounded and perish; 83:18 that they may know that you alone, whose name is Yahweh, are the Most High over all the earth.
