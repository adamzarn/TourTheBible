<<A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh, who shall dwell in your sanctuary? Who shall live on your holy hill? 15:2 He who walks blamelessly does what is right, and speaks truth in his heart; 15:3 He who doesn't slander with his tongue, nor does evil to his friend, nor casts slurs against his fellow man; 15:4 In whose eyes a vile man is despised, but who honors those who fear Yahweh; he who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and doesn't change; 15:5 he who doesn't lend out his money for usury, nor take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be shaken.
