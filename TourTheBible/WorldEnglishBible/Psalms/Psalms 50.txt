<<A Psalm by Asaph.>> The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, speaks, and calls the earth from sunrise to sunset. 50:2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth. 50:3 Our God comes, and does not keep silent. A fire devours before him. It is very stormy around him. 50:4 He calls to the heavens above, to the earth, that he may judge his people: 50:5 "Gather my saints together to me, those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice." 50:6 The heavens shall declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge. Selah. 50:7 "Hear, my people, and I will speak; Israel, and I will testify against you. I am God, your God. 50:8 I don't rebuke you for your sacrifices. Your burnt offerings are continually before me. 50:9 I have no need for a bull from your stall, nor male goats from your pens. 50:10 For every animal of the forest is mine, and the livestock on a thousand hills. 50:11 I know all the birds of the mountains. The wild animals of the field are mine. 50:12 If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is mine, and all that is in it. 50:13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? 50:14 Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving. Pay your vows to the Most High. 50:15 Call on me in the day of trouble. I will deliver you, and you will honor me." 50:16 But to the wicked God says, "What right do you have to declare my statutes, that you have taken my covenant on your lips, 50:17 seeing you hate instruction, and throw my words behind you? 50:18 When you saw a thief, you consented with him, and have participated with adulterers. 50:19 "You give your mouth to evil. Your tongue frames deceit. 50:20 You sit and speak against your brother. You slander your own mother's son. 50:21 You have done these things, and I kept silent. You thought that the I was just like you. I will rebuke you, and accuse you in front of your eyes. 50:22 "Now consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you into pieces, and there be none to deliver. 50:23 Whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me, and prepares his way so that I will show God's salvation to him."
