<<A Song of Ascents.>> I will lift up my eyes to the hills. Where does my help come from? 121:2 My help comes from Yahweh, who made heaven and earth. 121:3 He will not allow your foot to be moved. He who keeps you will not slumber. 121:4 Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. 121:5 Yahweh is your keeper. Yahweh is your shade on your right hand. 121:6 The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night. 121:7 Yahweh will keep you from all evil. He will keep your soul. 121:8 Yahweh will keep your going out and your coming in, from this time forth, and forevermore.
