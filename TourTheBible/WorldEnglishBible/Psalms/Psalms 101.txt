<<A Psalm by David.>> I will sing of loving kindness and justice. To you, Yahweh, I will sing praises. 101:2 I will be careful to live a blameless life. When will you come to me? I will walk within my house with a blameless heart. 101:3 I will set no vile thing before my eyes. I hate the deeds of faithless men. They will not cling to me. 101:4 A perverse heart will be far from me. I will have nothing to do with evil. 101:5 I will silence whoever secretly slanders his neighbor. I won't tolerate one who is haughty and conceited. 101:6 My eyes will be on the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me. He who walks in a perfect way, he will serve me. 101:7 He who practices deceit won't dwell within my house. He who speaks falsehood won't be established before my eyes. 101:8 Morning by morning, I will destroy all the wicked of the land; to cut off all the workers of iniquity from Yahweh's city.
