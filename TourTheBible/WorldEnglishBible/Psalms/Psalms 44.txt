<<For the Chief Musician. By the sons of Korah. A contemplative psalm.>> We have heard with our ears, God; our fathers have told us, what work you did in their days, in the days of old. 44:2 You drove out the nations with your hand, but you planted them. You afflicted the peoples, but you spread them abroad. 44:3 For they didn't get the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them; but your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your face, because you were favorable to them. 44:4 You are my King, God. Command victories for Jacob! 44:5 Through you, will we push down our adversaries. Through your name, will we tread them under who rise up against us. 44:6 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me. 44:7 But you have saved us from our adversaries, and have shamed those who hate us. 44:8 In God we have made our boast all day long, we will give thanks to your name forever. Selah. 44:9 But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonor, and don't go out with our armies. 44:10 You make us turn back from the adversary. Those who hate us take spoil for themselves. 44:11 You have made us like sheep for food, and have scattered us among the nations. 44:12 You sell your people for nothing, and have gained nothing from their sale. 44:13 You make us a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us. 44:14 You make us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples. 44:15 All day long my dishonor is before me, and shame covers my face, 44:16 At the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses, because of the enemy and the avenger. 44:17 All this has come on us, yet have we not forgotten you, Neither have we been false to your covenant. 44:18 Our heart has not turned back, neither have our steps strayed from your path, 44:19 Though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals, and covered us with the shadow of death. 44:20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or spread forth our hands to a strange god; 44:21 won't God search this out? For he knows the secrets of the heart. 44:22 Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long. We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter. 44:23 Wake up! Why do you sleep, Lord? Arise! Don't reject us forever. 44:24 Why do you hide your face, and forget our affliction and our oppression? 44:25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust. Our body cleaves to the earth. 44:26 Rise up to help us. Redeem us for your loving kindness' sake.
