<<By David.>> Judge me, Yahweh, for I have walked in my integrity. I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering. 26:2 Examine me, Yahweh, and prove me. Try my heart and my mind. 26:3 For your loving kindness is before my eyes. I have walked in your truth. 26:4 I have not sat with deceitful men, neither will I go in with hypocrites. 26:5 I hate the assembly of evil-doers, and will not sit with the wicked. 26:6 I will wash my hands in innocence, so I will go about your altar, Yahweh; 26:7 that I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard, and tell of all your wondrous works. 26:8 Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house, the place where your glory dwells. 26:9 Don't gather my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloodthirsty men; 26:10 in whose hands is wickedness, their right hand is full of bribes. 26:11 But as for me, I will walk in my integrity. Redeem me, and be merciful to me. 26:12 My foot stands in an even place. In the congregations I will bless Yahweh.
