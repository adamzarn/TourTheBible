<<A Song of Ascents.>> Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up. Let Israel now say, 129:2 many times they have afflicted me from my youth up, yet they have not prevailed against me. 129:3 The plowers plowed on my back. They made their furrows long. 129:4 Yahweh is righteous. He has cut apart the cords of the wicked. 129:5 Let them be disappointed and turned backward, all those who hate Zion. 129:6 Let them be as the grass on the housetops, which withers before it grows up; 129:7 with which the reaper doesn't fill his hand, nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom. 129:8 Neither do those who go by say, "The blessing of Yahweh be on you. We bless you in the name of Yahweh."
