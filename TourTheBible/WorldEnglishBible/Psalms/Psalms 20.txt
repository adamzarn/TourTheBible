<<For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.>> May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble. May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high, 20:2 send you help from the sanctuary, grant you support from Zion, 20:3 remember all your offerings, and accept your burnt sacrifice. Selah. 20:4 May He grant you your heart's desire, and fulfill all your counsel. 20:5 We will triumph in your salvation. In the name of our God, we will set up our banners. May Yahweh grant all your requests. 20:6 Now I know that Yahweh saves his anointed. He will answer him from his holy heaven, with the saving strength of his right hand. 20:7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we trust the name of Yahweh our God. 20:8 They are bowed down and fallen, but we rise up, and stand upright. 20:9 Save, Yahweh! Let the King answer us when we call!
