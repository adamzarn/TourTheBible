<<A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed and pours out his complaint before Yahweh.>> Hear my prayer, Yahweh! Let my cry come to you. 102:2 Don't hide your face from me in the day of my distress. Turn your ear to me. Answer me quickly in the day when I call. 102:3 For my days consume away like smoke. My bones are burned as a firebrand. 102:4 My heart is blighted like grass, and withered, for I forget to eat my bread. 102:5 By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bones stick to my skin. 102:6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness. I have become as an owl of the waste places. 102:7 I watch, and have become like a sparrow that is alone on the housetop. 102:8 My enemies reproach me all day. Those who are mad at me use my name as a curse. 102:9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mixed my drink with tears, 102:10 Because of your indignation and your wrath, for you have taken me up, and thrown me away. 102:11 My days are like a long shadow. I have withered like grass. 102:12 But you, Yahweh, will abide forever; your renown endures to all generations. 102:13 You will arise and have mercy on Zion; for it is time to have pity on her. Yes, the set time has come. 102:14 For your servants take pleasure in her stones, and have pity on her dust. 102:15 So the nations will fear the name of Yahweh; all the kings of the earth your glory. 102:16 For Yahweh has built up Zion. He has appeared in his glory. 102:17 He has responded to the prayer of the destitute, and has not despised their prayer. 102:18 This will be written for the generation to come. A people which will be created will praise Yah. 102:19 For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary. From heaven, Yahweh saw the earth; 102:20 to hear the groans of the prisoner; to free those who are condemned to death; 102:21 that men may declare the name of Yahweh in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem; 102:22 when the peoples are gathered together, the kingdoms, to serve Yahweh. 102:23 He weakened my strength along the course. He shortened my days. 102:24 I said, "My God, don't take me away in the midst of my days. Your years are throughout all generations. 102:25 Of old, you laid the foundation of the earth. The heavens are the work of your hands. 102:26 They will perish, but you will endure. Yes, all of them will wear out like a garment. You will change them like a cloak, and they will be changed. 102:27 But you are the same. Your years will have no end. 102:28 The children of your servants will continue. Their seed will be established before you."
