Praise Yah! Blessed is the man who fears Yahweh, who delights greatly in his commandments. 112:2 His seed will be mighty in the land. The generation of the upright will be blessed. 112:3 Wealth and riches are in his house. His righteousness endures forever. 112:4 Light dawns in the darkness for the upright, gracious, merciful, and righteous. 112:5 It is well with the man who deals graciously and lends. He will maintain his cause in judgment. 112:6 For he will never be shaken. The righteous will be remembered forever. 112:7 He will not be afraid of evil news. His heart is steadfast, trusting in Yahweh. 112:8 His heart is established. He will not be afraid in the end when he sees his adversaries. 112:9 He has dispersed, he has given to the poor. His righteousness endures forever. His horn will be exalted with honor. 112:10 The wicked will see it, and be grieved. He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away. The desire of the wicked will perish.
