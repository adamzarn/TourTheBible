<<For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Silent Dove in Distant Lands." A poem by David, when the Philistines seized him in Gath.>> Be merciful to me, God, for man wants to swallow me up. All day long, he attacks and oppresses me. 56:2 My enemies want to swallow me up all day long, for they are many who fight proudly against me. 56:3 When I am afraid, I will put my trust in you. 56:4 In God, I praise his word. In God, I put my trust. I will not be afraid. What can flesh do to me? 56:5 All day long they twist my words. All their thoughts are against me for evil. 56:6 They conspire and lurk, watching my steps, they are eager to take my life. 56:7 Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, God. 56:8 You number my wanderings. You put my tears into your bottle. Aren't they in your book? 56:9 Then my enemies shall turn back in the day that I call. I know this, that God is for me. 56:10 In God, I will praise his word. In Yahweh, I will praise his word. 56:11 I have put my trust in God. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me? 56:12 Your vows are on me, God. I will give thank offerings to you. 56:13 For you have delivered my soul from death, and prevented my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living.
