<<A Psalm by David, when he fled from Absalom his son.>> Yahweh, how my adversaries have increased! Many are those who rise up against me. 3:2 Many there are who say of my soul, "There is no help for him in God." Selah. 3:3 But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head. 3:4 I cry to Yahweh with my voice, and he answers me out of his holy hill. Selah. 3:5 I laid myself down and slept. I awakened; for Yahweh sustains me. 3:6 I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who have set themselves against me on every side. 3:7 Arise, Yahweh! Save me, my God! For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone. You have broken the teeth of the wicked. 3:8 Salvation belongs to Yahweh. Your blessing be on your people. Selah.
