Praise Yah, for it is good to sing praises to our God; for it is pleasant and fitting to praise him. 147:2 Yahweh builds up Jerusalem. He gathers together the outcasts of Israel. 147:3 He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds. 147:4 He counts the number of the stars. He calls them all by their names. 147:5 Great is our Lord, and mighty in power. His understanding is infinite. 147:6 Yahweh upholds the humble. He brings the wicked down to the ground. 147:7 Sing to Yahweh with thanksgiving. Sing praises on the harp to our God, 147:8 who covers the sky with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth, who makes grass grow on the mountains. 147:9 He provides food for the livestock, and for the young ravens when they call. 147:10 He doesn't delight in the strength of the horse. He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man. 147:11 Yahweh takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope in his loving kindness. 147:12 Praise Yahweh, Jerusalem! Praise your God, Zion! 147:13 For he has strengthened the bars of your gates. He has blessed your children within you. 147:14 He makes peace in your borders. He fills you with the finest of the wheat. 147:15 He sends out his commandment to the earth. His word runs very swiftly. 147:16 He gives snow like wool, and scatters frost like ashes. 147:17 He hurls down his hail like pebbles. Who can stand before his cold? 147:18 He sends out his word, and melts them. He causes his wind to blow, and the waters flow. 147:19 He shows his word to Jacob; his statutes and his ordinances to Israel. 147:20 He has not done this for just any nation. They don't know his ordinances. Praise Yah!
