<<For the Chief Musician. To Jeduthan. A Psalm by David.>> My soul rests in God alone. My salvation is from him. 62:2 He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress--I will never be greatly shaken. 62:3 How long will you assault a man, would all of you throw him down, Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence? 62:4 They fully intend to throw him down from his lofty place. They delight in lies. They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah. 62:5 My soul, wait in silence for God alone, for my expectation is from him. 62:6 He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress. I will not be shaken. 62:7 With God is my salvation and my honor. The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. 62:8 Trust in him at all times, you people. Pour out your heart before him. God is a refuge for us. Selah. 62:9 Surely men of low degree are just a breath, and men of high degree are a lie. In the balances they will go up. They are together lighter than a breath. 62:10 Don't trust in oppression. Don't become vain in robbery. If riches increase, don't set your heart on them. 62:11 God has spoken once; twice I have heard this, that power belongs to God. 62:12 Also to you, Lord, belongs loving kindness, for you reward every man according to his work.
