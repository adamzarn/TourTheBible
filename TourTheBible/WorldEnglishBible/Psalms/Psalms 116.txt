I love Yahweh, because he listens to my voice, and my cries for mercy. 116:2 Because he has turned his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live. 116:3 The cords of death surrounded me, the pains of Sheol got a hold of me. I found trouble and sorrow. 116:4 Then called I on the name of Yahweh: "Yahweh, I beg you, deliver my soul." 116:5 Gracious is Yahweh, and righteous; yes, our God is merciful. 116:6 Yahweh preserves the simple. I was brought low, and he saved me. 116:7 Return to your rest, my soul, for Yahweh has dealt bountifully with you. 116:8 For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. 116:9 I will walk before Yahweh in the land of the living. 116:10 I believed, therefore I said, "I was greatly afflicted." 116:11 I said in my haste, "All men are liars." 116:12 What will I give to Yahweh for all his benefits toward me? 116:13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call on the name of Yahweh. 116:14 I will pay my vows to Yahweh, yes, in the presence of all his people. 116:15 Precious in the sight of Yahweh is the death of his saints. 116:16 Yahweh, truly I am your servant. I am your servant, the son of your handmaid. You have freed me from my chains. 116:17 I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call on the name of Yahweh. 116:18 I will pay my vows to Yahweh, yes, in the presence of all his people, 116:19 in the courts of Yahweh's house, in the midst of you, Jerusalem. Praise Yah!
