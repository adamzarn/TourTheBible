He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. 91:2 I will say of Yahweh, "He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust." 91:3 For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler, and from the deadly pestilence. 91:4 He will cover you with his feathers. Under his wings you will take refuge. His faithfulness is your shield and rampart. 91:5 You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flies by day; 91:6 nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor of the destruction that wastes at noonday. 91:7 A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; but it will not come near you. 91:8 You will only look with your eyes, and see the recompense of the wicked. 91:9 Because you have made Yahweh your refuge, and the Most High your dwelling place, 91:10 no evil shall happen to you, neither shall any plague come near your dwelling. 91:11 For he will give his angels charge over you, to guard you in all your ways. 91:12 They will bear you up in their hands, so that you won't dash your foot against a stone. 91:13 You will tread on the lion and cobra. You will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot. 91:14 "Because he has set his love on me, therefore I will deliver him. I will set him on high, because he has known my name. 91:15 He will call on me, and I will answer him. I will be with him in trouble. I will deliver him, and honor him. 91:16 I will satisfy him with long life, and show him my salvation."
