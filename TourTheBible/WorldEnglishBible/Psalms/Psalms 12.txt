<<For the Chief Musician; upon an eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm of David.>> Help, Yahweh; for the godly man ceases. For the faithful fail from among the children of men. 12:2 Everyone lies to his neighbor. They speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart. 12:3 May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that boasts, 12:4 who have said, "With our tongue we will prevail. Our lips are our own. Who is lord over us?" 12:5 "Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy, I will now arise," says Yahweh; "I will set him in safety from those who malign him." 12:6 The words of Yahweh are flawless words, as silver refined in a clay furnace, purified seven times. 12:7 You will keep them, Yahweh. You will preserve them from this generation forever. 12:8 The wicked walk on every side, when what is vile is exalted among the sons of men.
