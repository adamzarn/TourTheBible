<<A Song of Ascents. By David.>> I was glad when they said to me, "Let's go to Yahweh's house!" 122:2 Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem; 122:3 Jerusalem, that is built as a city that is compact together; 122:4 where the tribes go up, even Yah's tribes, according to an ordinance for Israel, to give thanks to the name of Yahweh. 122:5 For there are set thrones for judgment, the thrones of David's house. 122:6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Those who love you will prosper. 122:7 Peace be within your walls, and prosperity within your palaces. 122:8 For my brothers' and companions' sakes, I will now say, "Peace be within you." 122:9 For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God, I will seek your good.
