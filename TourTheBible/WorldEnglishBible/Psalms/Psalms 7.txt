<<A meditation by David, which he sang to Yahweh, concerning the words of Cush, the Benjamite.>> Yahweh, my God, I take refuge in you. Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me, 7:2 lest they tear apart my soul like a lion, ripping it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. 7:3 Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, if there is iniquity in my hands, 7:4 if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me (yes, if I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary), 7:5 let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; yes, let him tread my life down to the earth, and lay my glory in the dust. Selah. 7:6 Arise, Yahweh, in your anger. Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries. Awake for me. You have commanded judgment. 7:7 Let the congregation of the peoples surround you. Rule over them on high. 7:8 Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples. Judge me, Yahweh, according to my righteousness, and to my integrity that is in me. 7:9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous; their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God. 7:10 My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart. 7:11 God is a righteous judge, yes, a God who has indignation every day. 7:12 If a man doesn't relent, he will sharpen his sword; he has bent and strung his bow. 7:13 He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death. He makes ready his flaming arrows. 7:14 Behold, he travails with iniquity. Yes, he has conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood. 7:15 He has dug a hole, and has fallen into the pit which he made. 7:16 The trouble he causes shall return to his own head. His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head. 7:17 I will give thanks to Yahweh according to his righteousness, and will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High.
