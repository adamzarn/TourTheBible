<<A Psalm. A song for the Sabbath day.>> It is a good thing to give thanks to Yahweh, to sing praises to your name, Most High; 92:2 to proclaim your loving kindness in the morning, and your faithfulness every night, 92:3 with the ten-stringed lute, with the harp, and with the melody of the lyre. 92:4 For you, Yahweh, have made me glad through your work. I will triumph in the works of your hands. 92:5 How great are your works, Yahweh! Your thoughts are very deep. 92:6 A senseless man doesn't know, neither does a fool understand this: 92:7 though the wicked spring up as the grass, and all the evil-doers flourish, they will be destroyed forever. 92:8 But you, Yahweh, are on high forevermore. 92:9 For, behold, your enemies, Yahweh, for, behold, your enemies shall perish. All the evil-doers will be scattered. 92:10 But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox. I am anointed with fresh oil. 92:11 My eye has also seen my enemies. My ears have heard of the wicked enemies who rise up against me. 92:12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree. He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 92:13 They are planted in Yahweh's house. They will flourish in our God's courts. 92:14 They will still bring forth fruit in old age. They will be full of sap and green, 92:15 to show that Yahweh is upright. He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
