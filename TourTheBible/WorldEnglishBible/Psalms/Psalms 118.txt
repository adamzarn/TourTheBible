Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever. 118:2 Let Israel now say that his loving kindness endures forever. 118:3 Let the house of Aaron now say that his loving kindness endures forever. 118:4 Now let those who fear Yahweh say that his loving kindness endures forever. 118:5 Out of my distress, I called on Yah. Yah answered me with freedom. 118:6 Yahweh is on my side. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me? 118:7 Yahweh is on my side among those who help me. Therefore I will look in triumph at those who hate me. 118:8 It is better to take refuge in Yahweh, than to put confidence in man. 118:9 It is better to take refuge in Yahweh, than to put confidence in princes. 118:10 All the nations surrounded me, but in the name of Yahweh, I cut them off. 118:11 They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me. In the name of Yahweh I indeed cut them off. 118:12 They surrounded me like bees. They are quenched like the burning thorns. In the name of Yahweh I cut them off. 118:13 You pushed me back hard, to make me fall, but Yahweh helped me. 118:14 Yah is my strength and song. He has become my salvation. 118:15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous. "The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly. 118:16 The right hand of Yahweh is exalted! The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly!" 118:17 I will not die, but live, and declare Yah's works. 118:18 Yah has punished me severely, but he has not given me over to death. 118:19 Open to me the gates of righteousness. I will enter into them. I will give thanks to Yah. 118:20 This is the gate of Yahweh; the righteous will enter into it. 118:21 I will give thanks to you, for you have answered me, and have become my salvation. 118:22 The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner. 118:23 This is Yahweh's doing. It is marvelous in our eyes. 118:24 This is the day that Yahweh has made. We will rejoice and be glad in it! 118:25 Save us now, we beg you, Yahweh! Yahweh, we beg you, send prosperity now. 118:26 Blessed is he who comes in the name of Yahweh! We have blessed you out of the house of Yahweh. 118:27 Yahweh is God, and he has given us light. Bind the sacrifice with cords, even to the horns of the altar. 118:28 You are my God, and I will give thanks to you. You are my God, I will exalt you. 118:29 Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever.
