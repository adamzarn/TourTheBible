<<A Song. A Psalm by the sons of Korah.>> Great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised, in the city of our God, in his holy mountain. 48:2 Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion, on the north sides, the city of the great King. 48:3 God has shown himself in her citadels as a refuge. 48:4 For, behold, the kings assembled themselves, they passed by together. 48:5 They saw it, then they were amazed. They were dismayed. They hurried away. 48:6 Trembling took hold of them there, pain, as of a woman in travail. 48:7 With the east wind, you break the ships of Tarshish. 48:8 As we have heard, so we have seen, in the city of Yahweh of Armies, in the city of our God. God will establish it forever. Selah. 48:9 We have thought about your loving kindness, God, in the midst of your temple. 48:10 As is your name, God, so is your praise to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is full of righteousness. 48:11 Let Mount Zion be glad! Let the daughters of Judah rejoice, Because of your judgments. 48:12 Walk about Zion, and go around her. Number its towers. 48:13 Mark well her bulwarks. Consider her palaces, that you may tell it to the next generation. 48:14 For this God is our God forever and ever. He will be our guide even to death.
