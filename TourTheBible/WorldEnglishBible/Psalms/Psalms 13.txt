<<For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.>> How long, Yahweh? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? 13:2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart every day? How long shall my enemy triumph over me? 13:3 Behold, and answer me, Yahweh, my God. Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death; 13:4 Lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed against him;" Lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall. 13:5 But I trust in your loving kindness. My heart rejoices in your salvation. 13:6 I will sing to Yahweh, because he has been good to me.
