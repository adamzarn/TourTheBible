Yahweh reigns! He is clothed with majesty! Yahweh is armed with strength. The world also is established. It can't be moved. 93:2 Your throne is established from long ago. You are from everlasting. 93:3 The floods have lifted up, Yahweh, the floods have lifted up their voice. The floods lift up their waves. 93:4 Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea, Yahweh on high is mighty. 93:5 Your statutes stand firm. Holiness adorns your house, Yahweh, forevermore.
