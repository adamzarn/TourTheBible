<<A Song of Ascents. By David.>> Yahweh, my heart isn't haughty, nor my eyes lofty; nor do I concern myself with great matters, or things too wonderful for me. 131:2 Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me. 131:3 Israel, hope in Yahweh, from this time forth and forevermore.
