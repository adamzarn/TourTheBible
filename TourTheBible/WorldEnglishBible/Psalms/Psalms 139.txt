<<For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh, you have searched me, and you know me. 139:2 You know my sitting down and my rising up. You perceive my thoughts from afar. 139:3 You search out my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways. 139:4 For there is not a word on my tongue, but, behold, Yahweh, you know it altogether. 139:5 You hem me in behind and before. You laid your hand on me. 139:6 This knowledge is beyond me. It's lofty. I can't attain it. 139:7 Where could I go from your Spirit? Or where could I flee from your presence? 139:8 If I ascend up into heaven, you are there. If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, you are there! 139:9 If I take the wings of the dawn, and settle in the uttermost parts of the sea; 139:10 Even there your hand will lead me, and your right hand will hold me. 139:11 If I say, "Surely the darkness will overwhelm me; the light around me will be night;" 139:12 even the darkness doesn't hide from you, but the night shines as the day. The darkness is like light to you. 139:13 For you formed my inmost being. You knit me together in my mother's womb. 139:14 I will give thanks to you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful. My soul knows that very well. 139:15 My frame wasn't hidden from you, when I was made in secret, woven together in the depths of the earth. 139:16 Your eyes saw my body. In your book they were all written, the days that were ordained for me, when as yet there were none of them. 139:17 How precious to me are your thoughts, God! How vast is the sum of them! 139:18 If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand. When I wake up, I am still with you. 139:19 If only you, God, would kill the wicked. Get away from me, you bloodthirsty men! 139:20 For they speak against you wickedly. Your enemies take your name in vain. 139:21 Yahweh, don't I hate those who hate you? Am I not grieved with those who rise up against you? 139:22 I hate them with perfect hatred. They have become my enemies. 139:23 Search me, God, and know my heart. Try me, and know my thoughts. 139:24 See if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the everlasting way.
