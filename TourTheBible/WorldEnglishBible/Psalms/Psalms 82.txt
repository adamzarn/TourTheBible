<<A Psalm by Asaph.>> God presides in the great assembly. He judges among the gods. 82:2 "How long will you judge unjustly, and show partiality to the wicked?" Selah. 82:3 "Defend the weak, the poor, and the fatherless. Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed. 82:4 Rescue the weak and needy. Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked." 82:5 They don't know, neither do they understand. They walk back and forth in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are shaken. 82:6 I said, "You are gods, all of you are sons of the Most High. 82:7 Nevertheless you shall die like men, and fall like one of the rulers." 82:8 Arise, God, judge the earth, for you inherit all of the nations.
