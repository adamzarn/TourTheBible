<<For the Chief Musician. To Jeduthun. A Psalm by Asaph.>> My cry goes to God! Indeed, I cry to God for help, and for him to listen to me. 77:2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord. My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn't get tired. My soul refused to be comforted. 77:3 I remember God, and I groan. I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah. 77:4 You hold my eyelids open. I am so troubled that I can't speak. 77:5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. 77:6 I remember my song in the night. I consider in my own heart; my spirit diligently inquires: 77:7 "Will the Lord reject us forever? Will he be favorable no more? 77:8 Has his loving kindness vanished forever? Does his promise fail for generations? 77:9 Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?" Selah. 77:10 Then I thought, "I will appeal to this: the years of the right hand of the Most High." 77:11 I will remember Yah's deeds; for I will remember your wonders of old. 77:12 I will also meditate on all your work, and consider your doings. 77:13 Your way, God, is in the sanctuary. What god is great like God? 77:14 You are the God who does wonders. You have made your strength known among the peoples. 77:15 You have redeemed your people with your arm, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. 77:16 The waters saw you, God. The waters saw you, and they writhed. The depths also convulsed. 77:17 The clouds poured out water. The skies resounded with thunder. Your arrows also flashed around. 77:18 The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind. The lightnings lit up the world. The earth trembled and shook. 77:19 Your way was through the sea; your paths through the great waters. Your footsteps were not known. 77:20 You led your people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
