Praise Yah! Praise Yahweh from the heavens! Praise him in the heights! 148:2 Praise him, all his angels! Praise him, all his army! 148:3 Praise him, sun and moon! Praise him, all you shining stars! 148:4 Praise him, you heavens of heavens, You waters that are above the heavens. 148:5 Let them praise the name of Yahweh, For he commanded, and they were created. 148:6 He has also established them forever and ever. He has made a decree which will not pass away. 148:7 Praise Yahweh from the earth, you great sea creatures, and all depths! 148:8 Lightning and hail, snow and clouds; stormy wind, fulfilling his word; 148:9 mountains and all hills; fruit trees and all cedars; 148:10 wild animals and all livestock; small creatures and flying birds; 148:11 kings of the earth and all peoples; princes and all judges of the earth; 148:12 both young men and maidens; old men and children: 148:13 let them praise the name of Yahweh, for his name alone is exalted. His glory is above the earth and the heavens. 148:14 He has lifted up the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near to him. Praise Yah!
