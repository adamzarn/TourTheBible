Not to us, Yahweh, not to us, but to your name give glory, for your loving kindness, and for your truth's sake. 115:2 Why should the nations say, "Where is their God, now?" 115:3 But our God is in the heavens. He does whatever he pleases. 115:4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 115:5 They have mouths, but they don't speak. They have eyes, but they don't see. 115:6 They have ears, but they don't hear. They have noses, but they don't smell. 115:7 They have hands, but they don't feel. They have feet, but they don't walk, neither do they speak through their throat. 115:8 Those who make them will be like them; yes, everyone who trusts in them. 115:9 Israel, trust in Yahweh! He is their help and their shield. 115:10 House of Aaron, trust in Yahweh! He is their help and their shield. 115:11 You who fear Yahweh, trust in Yahweh! He is their help and their shield. 115:12 Yahweh remembers us. He will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel. He will bless the house of Aaron. 115:13 He will bless those who fear Yahweh, both small and great. 115:14 May Yahweh increase you more and more, you and your children. 115:15 Blessed are you by Yahweh, who made heaven and earth. 115:16 The heavens are the heavens of Yahweh; but the earth has he given to the children of men. 115:17 The dead don't praise Yah, neither any who go down into silence; 115:18 But we will bless Yah, from this time forth and forevermore. Praise Yah!
