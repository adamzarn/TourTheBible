<<For the Chief Musician. A contemplation by the sons of Korah.>> As the deer pants for the water brooks, so my soul pants after you, God. 42:2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God? 42:3 My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually ask me, "Where is your God?" 42:4 These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, how I used to go with the crowd, and led them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping a holy day. 42:5 Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise him for the saving help of his presence. 42:6 My God, my soul is in despair within me. Therefore I remember you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon, from the hill Mizar. 42:7 Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls. All your waves and your billows have swept over me. 42:8 Yahweh will command his loving kindness in the daytime. In the night his song shall be with me: a prayer to the God of my life. 42:9 I will ask God, my rock, "Why have you forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?" 42:10 As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries reproach me, while they continually ask me, "Where is your God?" 42:11 Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise him, the saving help of my countenance, and my God.
