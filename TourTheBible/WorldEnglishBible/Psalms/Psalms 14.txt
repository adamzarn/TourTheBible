<<For the Chief Musician. By David.>> The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt. They have done abominable works. There is none who does good. 14:2 Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any who did understand, who did seek after God. 14:3 They have all gone aside. They have together become corrupt. There is none who does good, no, not one. 14:4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and don't call on Yahweh? 14:5 There they were in great fear, for God is in the generation of the righteous. 14:6 You frustrate the plan of the poor, because Yahweh is his refuge. 14:7 Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When Yahweh restores the fortunes of his people, then Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
