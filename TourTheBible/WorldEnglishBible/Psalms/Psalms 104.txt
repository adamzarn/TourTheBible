Bless Yahweh, my soul. Yahweh, my God, you are very great. You are clothed with honor and majesty. 104:2 He covers himself with light as with a garment. He stretches out the heavens like a curtain. 104:3 He lays the beams of his chambers in the waters. He makes the clouds his chariot. He walks on the wings of the wind. 104:4 He makes his messengers winds; his servants flames of fire. 104:5 He laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be moved forever. 104:6 You covered it with the deep as with a cloak. The waters stood above the mountains. 104:7 At your rebuke they fled. At the voice of your thunder they hurried away. 104:8 The mountains rose, the valleys sank down, to the place which you had assigned to them. 104:9 You have set a boundary that they may not pass over; that they don't turn again to cover the earth. 104:10 He sends forth springs into the valleys. They run among the mountains. 104:11 They give drink to every animal of the field. The wild donkeys quench their thirst. 104:12 The birds of the sky nest by them. They sing among the branches. 104:13 He waters the mountains from his chambers. The earth is filled with the fruit of your works. 104:14 He causes the grass to grow for the livestock, and plants for man to cultivate, that he may bring forth food out of the earth: 104:15 wine that makes glad the heart of man, oil to make his face to shine, and bread that strengthens man's heart. 104:16 Yahweh's trees are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted; 104:17 where the birds make their nests. The stork makes its home in the fir trees. 104:18 The high mountains are for the wild goats. The rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers. 104:19 He appointed the moon for seasons. The sun knows when to set. 104:20 You make darkness, and it is night, in which all the animals of the forest prowl. 104:21 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God. 104:22 The sun rises, and they steal away, and lay down in their dens. 104:23 Man goes forth to his work, to his labor until the evening. 104:24 Yahweh, how many are your works! In wisdom have you made them all. The earth is full of your riches. 104:25 There is the sea, great and wide, in which are innumerable living things, both small and large animals. 104:26 There the ships go, and leviathan, whom you formed to play there. 104:27 These all wait for you, that you may give them their food in due season. 104:28 You give to them; they gather. You open your hand; they are satisfied with good. 104:29 You hide your face: they are troubled; you take away their breath: they die, and return to the dust. 104:30 You send forth your Spirit: they are created. You renew the face of the ground. 104:31 Let the glory of Yahweh endure forever. Let Yahweh rejoice in his works. 104:32 He looks at the earth, and it trembles. He touches the mountains, and they smoke. 104:33 I will sing to Yahweh as long as I live. I will sing praise to my God while I have any being. 104:34 Let your meditation be sweet to him. I will rejoice in Yahweh. 104:35 Let sinners be consumed out of the earth. Let the wicked be no more. Bless Yahweh, my soul. Praise Yah!
