The princes of the people lived in Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts in the [other] cities. 11:2 The people blessed all the men who willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem. 11:3 Now these are the chiefs of the province who lived in Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah lived everyone in his possession in their cities, [to wit], Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon's servants. 11:4 In Jerusalem lived certain of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the children of Perez; 11:5 and Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Colhozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of the Shilonite. 11:6 All the sons of Perez who lived in Jerusalem were four hundred sixty-eight valiant men. 11:7 These are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah. 11:8 After him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred twenty-eight. 11:9 Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer; and Judah the son of Hassenuah was second over the city. 11:10 Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin, 11:11 Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God, 11:12 and their brothers who did the work of the house, eight hundred twenty-two; and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah, 11:13 and his brothers, chiefs of fathers' [houses], two hundred forty-two; and Amashsai the son of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer, 11:14 and their brothers, mighty men of valor, one hundred twenty-eight; and their overseer was Zabdiel, the son of Haggedolim. 11:15 Of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni; 11:16 and Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chiefs of the Levites, who had the oversight of the outward business of the house of God; 11:17 and Mattaniah the son of Mica, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, who was the chief to begin the thanksgiving in prayer, and Bakbukiah, the second among his brothers; and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun. 11:18 All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred eighty-four. 11:19 Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brothers, who kept watch at the gates, were one hundred seventy-two. 11:20 The residue of Israel, of the priests, the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, everyone in his inheritance. 11:21 But the Nethinim lived in Ophel: and Ziha and Gishpa were over the Nethinim. 11:22 The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, the singers, over the business of the house of God. 11:23 For there was a commandment from the king concerning them, and a settled provision for the singers, as every day required. 11:24 Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all matters concerning the people. 11:25 As for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of Judah lived in Kiriath Arba and the towns of it, and in Dibon and the towns of it, and in Jekabzeel and the villages of it, 11:26 and in Jeshua, and in Moladah, and Beth Pelet, 11:27 and in Hazar Shual, and in Beersheba and the towns of it, 11:28 and in Ziklag, and in Meconah and in the towns of it, 11:29 and in En Rimmon, and in Zorah, and in Jarmuth, 11:30 Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and the fields of it, Azekah and the towns of it. So they encamped from Beersheba to the valley of Hinnom. 11:31 The children of Benjamin also [lived] from Geba [onward], at Michmash and Aija, and at Bethel and the towns of it, 11:32 at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, 11:33 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, 11:34 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, 11:35 Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen. 11:36 Of the Levites, certain divisions in Judah [were joined] to Benjamin.
